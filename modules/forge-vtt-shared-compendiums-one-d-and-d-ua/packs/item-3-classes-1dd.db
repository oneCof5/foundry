Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, Wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><p>Beyond the sheer power of the spells they cast, though, Wizards share an approach to magic that is scholarly and exacting. Wizards understand magic at a fundamental level, giving them a precise mastery of their spells. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic, and use those foundations to alter their spells and even craft entirely new spells. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, Yolande, and many more invented iconic spells now used across the multiverse.</p><p>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other Wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous Wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>DESIGN NOTE: WIZARD UPDATES</strong></p><p>Here are the main updates in this class, most of which were inspired by the Player’s Handbook survey in 2021:</p><p>• Spellcasting now allows you to use your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus.</p><p>• Wizard’s Spellbook is a new 1st-level feature, which consolidates spellbook rules in one place.</p><p>In addition, this feature gives you a Wizard-only spell: Scribe Spell.</p><p>• Academic is a new 2nd-level feature.</p><p>• Arcane Recovery has moved from 1st level

18th level to 15th level.</p><p>• Signature Spells has moved from 20th level to 18th level.</p><p>• Epic Boon is a new 20th-level feature that increases an ability score, raises that score’s maximum to 30, and gives an Epic Boon feat</p></aside><h3>The Wizard Table</h3><table><thead><tr><th rowspan=\"2\">Level</th><th rowspan=\"2\"><p>Proficiency<br />Bonus</p></th><th
