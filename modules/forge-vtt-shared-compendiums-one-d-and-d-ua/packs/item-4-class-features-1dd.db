See the <em>Player's Handbook</em> for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Wizard.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You know three cantrips of your choice from the Arcane spell list. Rather than choosing, you may start with Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost. Whenever you gain a Wizard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another Arcane cantrip of your choice.</p><p>When you reach 4th and 10th level in this class, you learn another Arcane cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard table.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em>The Wizard table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Long Rest</span></span>.</p><p><em><strong>Spells of 1st+ Level.</strong></em> You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, you choose four spells from your spellbook, and the chosen spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Arcane spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. For example, if you're a 3rd-level Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.</p><p>If another Wizard feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.</p><p><em><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong></em> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing one or more of the spells there. Preparing a new list requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast a spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell you add to the list.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with your Wizard features.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you cast with your Wizard features.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"One D&D","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Wizard 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"549975b7e25c27a4441fae29efe74b8431b83040","sourceId":"Item.L0KJAzusTwgJ1sbq"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.L0KJAzusTwgJ1sbq"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682879198939,"modifiedTime":1682879322860,"lastModifiedBy":"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"CAnATdYhQzXlzxUe"}
