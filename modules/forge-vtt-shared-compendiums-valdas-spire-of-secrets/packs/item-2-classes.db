The room resonates with the sound of metal impacting metal, while the bright, hot piece of steel in her tongs begins to take shape.</p><p>An elf threads a needle with an impossibly thin metallic wire, preparing to set the stitches into what looks to be leather armor, but made of dragon’s hide. Once satisfied with the measurements, he proceeds with a flurry of dexterous needlework.</p><p>A gnome with an intricate set of goggles examines the stock for her latest work: a portable ballista. She examines the gearing and loading crank, ensures the tension on the bowstring, and scans the bolt rail for imperfections. She smiles, for she knows her work is without flaw.</p><p>Craftsmen are virtuoso artisans and genius inventors. Not content merely creating masterwork pieces of weapons and armor, they invent and engineer ingenious devices and singularly deadly weapons.</p><h2>Master of Craft</h2><p>Artisans of all types are an integral part of every culture: buildings must be erected, pots must be sent to the kiln, tools must be forged. Despite their pervasiveness, master craftsmen are still as rare as they are prized. These artisans, creators, and inventors can smith items of mythic quality, and can solve most any problem simply by using the right tool and the appropriate amount of force.</p><h2>Secret of Steel</h2><p>Adventuring craftsmen come in many varieties, but nearly all leverage their advanced knowledge of metallurgy, smelting, and construction to forge arms and armor rarely seen, even by other adventurers. The smiths test their schematics and designs themselves, building prototypes and experimental gear that can later be refined into mass-produced items.</p><h2>Creating a Craftsman</h2><p>When you create your craftsman, the most important thing to consider is your crafting expertise. Though all craftsmen of adventuring stock can stitch leather armor, forge weapons, and tinker with magic items, only those who dedicate themselves to a single craft can attain legendary works. Each type of craftsman, from the practical to the wildly eccentric, have their place, but no craftsman can specialize in everything.</p><p>Moreover, few craftsmen are self-taught. Most learn the finer points of their craft under the tutelage of a master artisan (whether or not their master was a craftsman, in the conventional sense). Did you study under a master, and if so, what drove you to apprentice underneath them?</p><p>Lastly, consider how you view your work. Are you pragmatic, viewing your creations as tools to serve a purpose? Are you artistic, striving to craft pieces of unrivaled beauty and perfection? Or are you experimental, tinkering and building with wild abandon to break new ground and innovate on established norms?</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p><p>You can make a craftsman quickly by following these suggestions. Make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Next, select Athletics and Investigation as your skills. Finally, choose a background befitting of your history of craftsmanship.</p></aside><h3>Craftsman Table</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Proficiency Bonus</th><th>Features</th><th>Active Crafting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>Exotic Proficiencies, Active Crafting</td><td>25 gp</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>Masterwork (Apprentice Properties), Tool Belt</td><td>25 gp</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>Artisan's Guild</td><td>50 gp</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>75 gp</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>Extra Attack, Masterwork (Journeyman properties)</td><td>100 gp</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>Folded Steel</td><td>125 gp</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>Artisan's Guild feature</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>175 gp</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>Eye for Quality</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>Artisan's Guild feature</td><td>225 gp</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>Masterwork (Master properties)</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>275 gp</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>Flawless Construction</td><td>300 gp</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>Artisan's Guild feature</td><td>325 gp</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>Uncanny Tool Belt</td><td>350 gp</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>375 gp</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>Masterwork (Legendary properties)</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>Artisan's Guild feature</td><td>425 gp</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>450 gp</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>Magnum Opus</td><td>500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Class Features</h2><p>As a craftsman, you gain the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d10 per craftsman level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 10 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per craftsman level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> All artisan’s tools</p><p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution, Intelligence</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from: Arcana, Athletics, History, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, and Persuasion.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li><p>A set of craftman’s tools</p></li><li><p>A shield and (a) chain mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) scale mail</p></li><li><p>A dagger and (a) a warhammer or (b) any simple weapon</p></li><li><p>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) a shortbow and 20 arrows</p></li><li><p>A dungeoneer’s pack</p></li></ul><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>CRAFTSMAN'S TOOLS</strong></p><p>As a craftsman, you carry a set of craftsman’s tools, a combined toolkit that covers a broad range of applications.

Masterwork weapons crafted or modified by you count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h2>Eye for Quality</h2><p>Starting at 9th level, you can cast the identify spell at will, without using a spell slot or spell components. Additionally, when you cast the spell, you also appraise the target item, learning its market value in gold pieces.</p><h2>Flawless Construction</h2><p>Beginning at 13th level, masterwork items you create don’t rust, pit, fray at the edges, or otherwise show signs of aging. Additionally, they have resistance to all damage. Items you create can only be destroyed by effects that can destroy magic items.</p><h2>Uncanny Tool Belt</h2><p>By 15th level, you have a knack for finding the most useful things buried away in your cart. You can produce a single common or uncommon magic item from your tool belt. The item becomes lost in your inventory and vanishes when you finish a long rest. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Magnum Opus</h2><p>At 20th level, you complete an object of unparalleled majesty. You work feverishly for a period of 30 days to create a single magic item of very rare or legendary rarity. This item is tied to your very soul: regardless of type, you are always considered attuned to it, and no other creature can attune to it while you are alive. This item doesn’t count against your maximum number of attuned items, and you ignore all attunement requirements for the item. As long as you are on the same plane of existence as your item, you can use a bonus action to call it to your hand or onto your body (as appropriate). You can only craft a Magnum Opus once.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"VSoS, pg 63","identifier":"craftsman","levels":1,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"4teihU73ChlZd7xV","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[],"optional":false,"spell":null},"value":{},"level":1}],"saves":["con","int"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ath","his","inv","med","prc","per"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"7959e08bc34d3ded4f6a6bd772616a94d2c1ab70","sourceId":"Item.jLwMjjCbiptwHH7H"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.jLwMjjCbiptwHH7H"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682977438190,"modifiedTime":1682992416530,"lastModifiedBy":"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"TJuFAzwiFHPdiXvp"}
