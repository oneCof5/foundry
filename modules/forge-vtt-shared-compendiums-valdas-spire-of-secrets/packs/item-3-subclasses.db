{"name":"Rumrunner","type":"subclass","img":"icons/consumables/drinks/alcohol-jug-spirits-brown.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Where rum flows easily, the gods of merriment abound. Clerics of the Rum Domain feel the fuzzy warmth of strong drink not as sinful excess, but as praise to the gods of good times, which they worship often and with abandon. They look to spread their merry religion and the good times with it, bringing all to peace and happiness, a few nights of drunken revelry at a time.</p><p><strong>Rum Domain Spells</strong></p><p><em>New spells are marked with an asterisk.</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>charm person, sleep</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>calm emotions, hangover*</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>hypnotic pattern, slow</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>confusion, death ward</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>greater restoration, modify memory</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Drunken Sway</h3><p>Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you always seem off balance, making you surprisingly difficult to hit. While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Additionally, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.</p><h3>Cup Floweth Over</h3><p>At 1st level, you can use your action to fill your mug with beer or rum, a gift of good tidings from the gods. Only you can drink this liquor, but you suffer no ill effect from drinking any amount of alcohol; though rosy-cheeked and slurred of speech, you are always steadfast on your feet and clear of thought. Additionally, you learn the legendary libation cantrip, which counts as a cleric spell for you and doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Intoxicate</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can call upon the gods of merrymaking to inebriate an aggressor. When a creature you can see makes an attack, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned and has disadvantage on saving throws for up to 1 minute. The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p><h3>Rumrunner</h3><p>By 6th level, you've learned the finer art of moving when nobody's paying attention. Whenever a hostile creature moves, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from the moving creature.</p><h3>Divine Strike</h3><p>&gt;</p><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h3>Next Round's On Me</h3><p>At 17th level, you can call upon the gods of good times to bring your allies a round of shots. As an action, choose up to 6 friendly creatures you can see within 60 feet of you to gain a pleasant buzz. For the next minute, you and each of these creatures have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, and can subtract your Wisdom modifier from bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage they take. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"rumrunner","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"WTuABJxOc4PO7VhN","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-valdas-spire-of-secrets.item-6-class-features.nVkAM1u2PIffBHnB","Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-valdas-spire-of-secrets.item-6-class-features.cpmnMePmBQB1wQR1"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Domain Features"}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"19644ee7651dbbfb3ae4c3992503defd819827f7","sourceId":"Item.2ikcWVGxr3CoTSmv"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ikcWVGxr3CoTSmv"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1683146504621,"modifiedTime":1683148478597,"lastModifiedBy":"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"KiwSrncVf1ZMNhl6"}
