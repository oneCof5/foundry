{"name":"Masterwork","type":"feat","img":"icons/skills/trades/smithing-tongs-metal-red.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You begin to learn the deeper intricacies of weapon and armor craftsmanship.</p><h3>Masterwork Equipment</h3><p>As a craftsman, you are capable of creating weapons and armor of the utmost quality; such creations are known as masterwork items. To create a masterwork version of an item, add 50 gp to the cost in materials you pay to craft the item. Masterwork weapons you create have a +1 bonus to attack rolls. A magic weapon that adds a bonus to your attack and damage rolls doesn’t add this bonus to attack rolls.</p><p><strong>Masterwork Properties</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Craftsman Level</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>2nd</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Journeyman</td><td>5th</td><td>100 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Master</td><td>11th</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Master</td><td>11th</td><td>250 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Masterwork Properties</h3><p>Masterwork weapons and armor can be modified with masterwork properties, advanced modifications that transform them into truly unique weapons and armor. Masterwork properties are separated into 4 levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, and Legendary. You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon, or up to three Apprentice properties to a masterwork suit of armor. Additionally, you can apply one Journeyman, one Master, and one Legendary property to each masterwork item.</p><p>If you add a <em>Master</em> or <em>Legendary</em> property to an item, only you can use it.</p><h3>Modifying Equipment</h3><p>Using the Active Crafting feature, you can modify a weapon or suit of armor when you take a long rest. This allows you to do the following:</p><p><strong>Improving Equipment.</strong> You can make any nonmagical weapon or suit of armor masterwork for a cost of 50 gp in materials.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>DOWNTIME CRAFTING</strong></p><p>Any character can craft nonmagical items in their downtime; the craftsman is simply better at it. To craft an item, a character requires three things:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Materials.</strong> In most cases, the raw materials for an item can be obtained for half the item’s gold piece cost. This cost can fluctuate depending on the character’s current circumstances, contacts, or access to materials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tools.</strong> You must have a set of appropriate artisan’s tools and proficiency with them to craft an item. Occasionally, an item might call for an entire workshop or other special tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time.</strong> The time required to craft an item is measured against its cost in materials. A character makes progress toward crafting an item equal to 5 gp for each day of downtime, completing their work when this amount exceeds the item’s cost in materials. As a craftsman, you work faster than a normal character, and make progress equal to 10 gp progress each day.</p></li></ul><p>You can sell any item you craft during your downtime for its total gold piece cost. As such, if you run a shop or craft items during your downtime purely to make profit, you can make 5 gp per day, assuming you sell all of your items.</p></aside><p><strong>Adding Masterwork Properties</strong>. Adding masterwork properties of Journeyman level or higher requires a cost in gold pieces and also requires you to be of a high enough level in this class, as shown in the Masterwork Properties table. When you learn a new level of masterwork properties, you can apply a property from that level to a masterwork item at no cost.</p><p>Check the Weapons Exceptions sidebar later in this chapter before adding masterwork properties to a weapon.</p><p>Whenever you modify the properties of a masterwork weapon, you can change its damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, if its damage was already one of these types.</p><p><strong>Removing Properties.</strong> You can remove any properties of a masterwork item, including those a weapon had when you first created it. You can’t remove a property from an item that is a prerequisite for another of the item’s properties. If you replace a property of Journeyman level or higher with a property of the same level over the same long rest, you can do so without an additional cost in materials.</p><h3>Crafting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is the primary ability you use when crafting items. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for items that you craft.</p><p><strong>Masterwork save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"VSoS","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"Craftsman 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"05e342325d86fd4b880b483ee640af657e05d822","sourceId":"Item.xxUS4veSnr3jlxWe"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.xxUS4veSnr3jlxWe"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682991870716,"modifiedTime":1682992148143,"lastModifiedBy":"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"CrW1dcu0tRd8vB9h"}
