Some of the entries include:</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #1</strong></p>\n<p>My miserable parents have found yet another way to drive me mad. It’s not enough that they drag me down to their meals and force me to sit in on their meetings. No - now they’re finding new ways to ruin my work by shoving this vapid little girl into my life. Her voice, her face, and her very being are pure frustration to me. Surely if I keep trying to work in front of her, she’ll be frightened and tell my parents of my work. How can I remove her?</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #2</strong></p>\n<p>I might be in trouble. That irritating little girl was sent up into my workroom with me. “Spend some time with her,” Father said; “You need to get to know each other!” I don’t want to get to know this stupid girl; I want to be left alone! </p>\n<p>She kept trying to talk to me, interrupting what little bits of work I could do in front of her. I finally cast a Fear spell on her to shut her up and drive her away from me. She spent the next minute cowering in the furthest corner of the room. It was only by the time the spell ended that I realized what I had done. She’ll tell someone what happened!</p>\n<p>I used one of my more difficult spells on her. I MADE her forget her fear. I hope it was enough.</p>\n<p>I’ve never used magic like that on a person before.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #3</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not in trouble! I’ve never been happier to see that round little face at my door. The magic worked! She doesn’t know what happened! She actually apologized for her panic attack and for embarrassing herself in front of me and assured me that it “wasn’t a regular occurrence.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand. I’m stuck with her again. But perhaps that’s a good thing. I have a lot to learn about magic, after all.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #4</strong></p>\n<p>Somehow, I forgot how ignorant this imbecilic town is. I don’t know why I worried so much. The stupid girl doesn’t know anything about magic. I tried a few more spells on her today, and even before I erased it from her mind, she had no idea what was happening. Still, it’s best to be careful.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t resist pulling a little prank on her, though. As she was leaving the house today, I gave her a little illusion that only she could see. It was pathetic how many people came running to see her scream.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #5</strong></p>\n<p>This is incredible! Magic is incredible! I’m like a god! I command her and she obeys; I wish her to be frightened and she is. And all the while, she doesn’t even know what is happening! </p>\n<p>Today, I finally used a spell on her that I have never been able to actually cast before. It seized control and bent her to my will - she could do nothing that I did not let her, yet she was aware the whole time!</p>\n<p>But I’ve found that that spell uses too much mana to allow me to alter her memory until tomorrow. I decided to kill two birds with one stone: I both got to see the extent to which I could control her, and embarrassed her enough that it was simplicity itself to plant the idea that she shouldn’t keep this incident a secret. It’s become so laughably easy to Suggest that she come back in the morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #6</strong></p>\n<p>As I expected, the stupid Wachter girl crawled back to me this morning, red-faced and quiet. I tidied up her memories, then sent her on her way. I couldn’t do anything too blatant to her today, given that I’d already changed her memories once. I decided to have a little fun instead. After a few illusions that no one else could see and a spell to scramble her stupid brain, she caused quite the hilarious scene.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #7</strong></p>\n<p>The stupid girl didn’t show up today, I guess she’s playing sick after her little episode yesterday. That won’t do; I have more things I want to test. There’s another spell I haven’t tried yet. It’s supposed to let me enter someone’s dreams and control what they see.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #8</strong></p>\n<p>Well, it worked. The stupid girl is back. But now that she is, I realize how much of my time she has been taking up. Even under my control, she’s still a nuisance. A distraction. </p>\n<p>Still, I’ve learned much about magic because of her. I think I’ll just have her play with the cats while I work.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #9</strong></p>\n<p>The girl is getting annoying again. She’s acting strange and can’t seem to keep a straight thought in her head until I pound her stupid brain into shape with a spell. Still, at least she’s becoming more responsive to my Suggestion spells; I don’t have to work twice as hard to twist her mind as I did a week ago.</p>\n<p>Playtime with the cats isn’t enough to keep her out of my hair. Maybe I can get her to pretend she is a cat. Meowing doesn’t distract me.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #10</strong></p>\n<p>This is excellent. The girl stays out of my way, a quick spell shoves her into her role as a cat, and from there she obeys without a single other spell. I can finally focus on what’s important - and she’s still handy if I become frustrated. Even when my work is at its hardest, it’s always satisfying to see my power in action.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #11</strong></p>\n<p>Father says the stupid girl isn’t coming back. Apparently, she woke up stuck in her role, still acting like a cat. I suppose this was bound to happen eventually. Her stupid little brain just couldn’t handle magic like mine can. Some of Father’s guards wanted to ask me what happened. It was easy to convince them that I’d had some arguments with the stupid girl, said some things I regret, and that her own delicate constitution had done the rest.</p>\n<p>Ignorant, weak-willed idiots.</p>\n<p>It’s a shame, too. I’d finally gotten used to her. I guess I can admit that when she wasn’t annoying me, she was a nice piece of scenery to have around. Maybe once I finish my work, I’ll take her with me. She’s already shown herself a good test subject, and it would be a nuisance to have to break another one in.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #12</strong></p>\n<p>I think it’s ready. Maybe now I can finally get out of this place. It’s a shame that girl isn’t here. I could have her try it out for me. I’m certainly not testing it first. Perhaps one of the servants might prove useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #13</strong></p>\n<p>Evidently, it’s not ready. Will keep trying.</p>\n<p><strong>Journal Entry #14</strong></p>\n<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>"},"_id":"ZAUtzB2gT3DcSRW1","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672519521851,"modifiedTime":1672519521851,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"1RgDbRCFrsJBW6vb","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

Wears dark traveler’s clothes underneath a cloak with a hood that she frequently hides under. Her face is dirty from travel but looks youthful. She actually creates this appearance using her disguise kit. Her body is deeply scarred with bite marks and cuts. There are also obvious signs of her undeath, as she appears stitched together in some parts. She wears leather gloves that hide her hands, that are pretty messed up from trying to claw her way out of the coffin that imprisoned her. She has on a bright silver locket that hangs around her neck that acts as a spell focus. The silver burns her if she holds it against her skin too long.</p>\n<p><strong>Disguise</strong>: Lilith hides the fact that she’s undead. She is known as a necromancer to the Order of the Gauntlet and they will kill her on sight if they recognize her. In her experience, when normal town folk of Faerun realize that she is undead, they fear her and will sometimes call the guards, or worse, summon the local clerics or paladins. In most cases, her outfit will protect her from being discovered. If someone has high perception, they might be able to tell that she’s not a Halfling, and question why a 9-year-old girl is talking to them like a grown up and going on adventures. Lilith’s undeath would quickly be discovered by events such as these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If she’s knocked unconscious, her hood might fall down and if it seems appropriate to the plot, this might be how its first revealed. If someone is running up to her, they would probably be able to see enough of her to realize what she is.</li>\n<li>Any sort of undead detection such as a Paladins Divine Sense ability</li>\n<li>Any attack or ability that targets undead that she happens to get hit with such as Turn Undead.</li>\n<li>She does not like to eat or drink and she does not sleep. The group might eventually notice this pattern.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Lilith’s Carefully Watching Priest</strong>: Lilith is fascinated by Priest. He does not seem to be hiding the fact that he is undead. This is crazy to her and she is very interested in seeing how people react. If they are accepting of him, she will be more likely to stop hiding what she is.</p>\n<h2>Personality</h2>\n<p>Lilith does not remember who she was when she was alive. She occasionally catches small glimpses of her past, but they are rare and fleeting.</p>\n<p>Lilith has two sides to her personality. She can be bright, cheerful and outgoing. This is a mask that she feels very comfortable wearing. She developed this after watching other girls her age. Her true self is incredibly guarded, scared, and focused on her own self-preservation.</p>\n<p>Lilith is not evil though. It’s probably better to think of her as feral. She takes no pleasure in other’s suffering, and will not seek it out.</p>\n<p>Lilith has experienced real trauma. She does not value life and has no stigma about death. She struggles with empathy and secretly puts her survival above others. On the surface though, she can come across as being kind and helpful. She will base her choices in social situations on what she feels the group expects of her. If she sees someone that needs help, she won’t help them because she thinks its right or that she doesn’t want to see someone get hurt. She’ll help them because she believes its what the group wants or views as normal.</p>\n<p>Lilith is still learning how to be a person. She can slip up from time to time.</p>\n<p>Lilith is afraid of 2 things: small enclosed spaces and religious zealots like the Order of the Gauntlet. She’ll ride on the back of wagons. The fact that Priest buries himself at night deeply disturbs her.</p>\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Lilith is here because she wants to know who she is and what happened to her. The fortune teller promised her that if she came, she could learn these secrets.</p>\n<p>When playing Lilith, it’ll be important to constantly keep this motivation in mind. At first, she is using the party to get what she wants. You need to sell this, but subtly, because otherwise, her growth won’t seem genuine.</p>\n<p>Lilith should grow as a character during this adventure. This will be her first time being around the same people for a long period of time. They’ll (hopefully) be people she can rely on and bond with. As she continues to grow, her motivation will change. She’ll still want to find out what happened to her, but she’ll also want to do right by her friends.</p>\n<h2>Back Story</h2>\n<p>Lilith woke up 10 or so years ago sealed in a coffin swarming with all manner of creepy crawlies. She woke up with no idea of who she was, how she got there or what had happened to her. Her mind was still like a human child’s at this point and the terror she felt was absolutely consuming. She tried desperately to kick and claw her way out and to escape the centipedes and spiders that swarmed her, but they seemed to gather around as if she was creating them herself. Her screams for help were unanswered. Mercifully, after a while, her mind just kind of broke, and she grew still.</p>\n<p>She did not die. She did not hunger, thirst or sleep. The poisonous bites and stings stopped hurting her. She was just trapped there, semi-conscious, almost in a meditative state trying to escape her awful reality.</p>\n<p>One day, she heard a soft female voice. Distant at first, but she could feel its warmth and she chased it through her consciousness. The voice gradually grew louder, telling her in a motherly voice, “Rise and shine my child, it’s time to wake up.” Power flowed through her body manifesting as sacred flames that set her coffin ablaze, quickly turning it to ash and incinerating her insect tormentors (that she was in fact creating). When she finally opened her eyes and focused back on reality for the first time in what felt like years, she realized that she was repeating the word that she had first heard and chased after, “Rise.”</p>\n<p>All around her, coffins not dissimilar to her own, began to burst open, the animated corpses rising up and shuffling over to her, standing at attention, awaiting her instructions.</p>\n<p>She found a locket with the name Lilith inscribed in it, in an ornamental box next to her crypt and began calling herself by that name.</p>\n<p>Lilith spent the next 8 years sealed away in this crypt with her undead servants. She pretended they were her friends, the way a kid might do with a doll, and after a while, forgot that they were not. She knew instinctually that she was different from them. She was sentient and felt in many ways alive. They were simply puppets.</p>\n<p>She would occasionally hear the voice whispering in the corners of her mind, but she was never able to hear it clearly again. Still, the magic that it awakened inside of her became an ever present part of her life. She mastered simple cantrips and learned how to cast a few low level spells. She found herself unable to animate any of the other corpses housed in the crypt, though she believed that with enough practice, she would be able to again.</p>\n<p>Lilith was finally freed from the tomb when a group of paladins and clerics from the Order of the Gauntlet came to purify the undead that they sensed residing in this place. Having lost her grip on reality, she tried to fight off these invaders that were attacking her friends. She killed a handful of them and escaped while the others focused down her friends.</p>\n<p>She spent the next couple of years on her own, spending time at the edges of various human settlements. She was bad at hiding her undead nature at first, and that led to her being chased out by villagers, guards and holy men. Even worse, the was known to the Order of the Gauntlet, and they were actively looking for her. But over time, she learned how to act more like a human. She became adept at disguising herself and she learned how to say the right thing to get what she wanted.</p>\n<p>It was around this time that she started to receive the Madam Eva’s visions and she made her way to Phandalin.</p>"},"_id":"OpdCKbmV2k6ciRM1","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672685771857,"modifiedTime":1672685771857,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"1vTSe2z0wd8AXIT6","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

She has eyes of baby blue, with lips, fingernails, and toenails the same color. She is flawless, despite (or because of) her necrotic chill.

Do not waste the gift she gave you, the gift of rebirth.

In time, you will grow powerful enough to know more, but stretching a mortal too far too quickly only breaks them.  I can tell you that your mother, Lilith, whose visage you bear around your neck, sacrificed her soul to save yours. Despite her ultimate sacrifice, trading her life for yours, she was not able to fully prevent your mortal demise.

Seek the Fortune Teller. She has experience with the strands of Fate within Barovia. She knows your next steps.\" </p>\n<p>The tomb fades from view.

My players know this, and they love/hate me for it. In the interest of spreading the terror, I thought I'd share my notes on how I'm running Strahd in my game. This is filtered through my perspective on Strahd as a character, so I'll drop my notes on that first.</p><h2>Overview</h2><h3>Strahd is smart.</h3><ul><li>Strahd's combat tactics should adapt to the players. He should figure out the party's weaknesses and target them explicitly. For example, a party with lots of single-target damage but little AoE capabilities will struggle with large hosts of weak enemies.</li><li>Strahd has long-since figured out that something is sabotaging his efforts to get Tatyana. This is why he doesn't just punch the party's teeth in and snatch her the moment they walk away from Barovia Town. \"Grab her and turn her into a vampire\" hasn't worked in 700 years, the PCs (as a wildcard not native to Barovia) present an opportunity to try more creative solutions.</li><li>Strahd is extremely well-informed. Between his spies, ability to Scry, and ability to Charm people for information, it should be rare that he is unaware of something.</li><li>Strahd should not make stupid mistakes. If he ever lays hands on the Villain Ball, I have done something wrong.</li></ul><h3>Strahd is a General</h3><p> </p><ul><li>Strahd's tactical acumen applies to any monsters he is commanding. The party should be able to tell when Strahd is directly in charge of enemies they are fighting because they will be drawn into ambushes and kill-boxes, be outflanked regularly, and have to deal with enemies targeting squishy party members first.</li><li>Strahd is very familiar with mixed-unit tactics and should use them. Look for tactical synergy between monsters under his control and exploit it. For example: zombie meat-shields backed up by skeleton archers and/or using wolves to run down the PCs and knock them Prone so slower units (like Vampire Spawn or Zombies) can catch up.</li><li>Strahd is familiar with the effectiveness of Magic as tactical support. The party should encounter Strahd-commanded monsters that have been magically buffed by spellcasters who didn't stick around for the actual fight</li><li>Strahd is familiar with the role of terrain in combat. The party should never have a terrain-based advantage when fighting Strahd-commanded forces, and Strahd should bring units well-suited to the environment. For example, if Strahd has the druids throw a horde of Blights at the party, they should attack on open terrain with no choke-points. In terrain with significant elevation differences, archers should be positioned on high-ground</li></ul><p> </p><h3>Strahd is a wizard with access to every single spell in the game</h3><p>If there's a 5th level or lower spell in the books that looks useful to Strahd, he has access to it.</p><h3>Strahd has absurd Ambush capabilities</h3><ul><li>He has the home-field advantage. He may have nests of monsters hidden all over the valley (like the Vampire Spawn in the coffin-maker's attic) that he can deploy. He has also had centuries to familiarize himself with the terrain to pick out good spots for an ambush. It's entirely possible for him to have minions he hid so long ago that all traces of their hiding place are gone (such as burying Zombies somewhere long enough ago that grass grew over their hidey hole).</li><li>He, personally, has absurd stealth capabilities between a very high Stealth check and the ability to go Invisible</li><li>Beucephalus allows him and his minions to travel via the Ethereal Plane...which is almost entirely imperceptible and completely intangible to people on the Material Plane and lets them ignore pesky things like walls. Bear in mind that Beucephalus can only move 3 willing creatures back and forth at a time. (Note: 'Charmed' can quickly become 'Willing.')</li></ul><h3>Strahd is Bored</h3><ul><li>With all the advantages Strahd has, if he wanted the party dead...they'd be dead. But, Strahd has been living in Barovia for centuries and there's nothing native to the valley that actually threatens him. Adventurers are a rare opportunity for him to find some entertainment. Strahd's entertainment primarily consists of terrorizing people and corrupting 'good' things. This all manifests in a few ways...</li><li>Strahd is not actually bothered when his plans don't work. Instead, he's impressed because it's something novel. He may congratulate the party on their accomplishment.</li><li>Strahd's plans are not always about achieving a tangible objective. For example, the Feast of St. Andrals is not some rare opportunity to get rid of a thorn in his side. If he really wanted the bones gone, they'd have been gone ages ago. He has lots of minions that are unaffected by holy ground (like cultists, druids, and werewolves) who could steal them and dispose of them much more thoroughly than hiding them in some old dude's closet. Rather, the plan was more about Henrik, Milivoj, and Yeska. Three people who don't serve Strahd that were manipulated into doing something that put the lives of a large number of people in danger and almost destroyed the one 'safe place' in the valley. Even leaving the bones in Henrik's closet was deliberately aimed to taunt him with the fact of \"You could fix this at any time, but you are too cowardly to risk it.\" And they get to deal with the knowledge of what they did for the rest of their lives.</li><li>Cities provide no actual protection from Strahd. None of them are actually capable of defending themselves against him and his forces. They continue to exist because he wants them to. After all, it's a lot more convenient when your food-stock takes care of itself and tends to its own pens. If Strahd decides a city needs to go, it's history. (The half-dozen Vampire Spawn that Strahd dropped in the coffin-maker's shop could, most likely, take out the entire guard force by themselves. 24 guards and a pallisade really isn't much in the way of viable defenses against a Vampire Lord.)</li><li>Strahd is trying to draw things out. Until the party reaches the 'too dangerous to let live' stage, he won't actively try to kill PCs. If they just happen to die, then oh well, guess they weren't going to be interesting anyway.</li><li>Strahd's campaign against the PCs should be psychological warfare heavy.</li></ul><h3>Strahd is a Prisoner</h3><ul><li>For all his power, for all his might...Strahd is a prisoner in the lands of Barovia. With his permission, anyone can safely leave Barovia--except for him. He is both Lord of Barovia, and the inmate that can never leave.</li><li>Strahd has an ancient agreement with the Vistani, giving them free passage through his lands. In exchange, they act as informants for him. (Some Vistani serve him directly, but this is not the norm.) This is how he gets news from the outside if he is interested.</li><li>Strahd is aware that something more powerful than him is toying with him, and is trying to find a way to break their grip on him.</li></ul><p>Strahd Is The Land</p><ul><li>Strahd has an intrinsic tie to Barovia, this has a few effects.</li><li>Weather conditions conspire to favor Strahd. This can mean anything from him getting Dramatic Cracks of Thunder whenever he wants them, to having a heavy rain or fog obscuring sight and sound when he wants to be sneaky, to just making people he doesn't like miserable.</li><li>On a grand scale, Strahd can alter the environment. Historically, he used this power to destroy the town of Berez by flooding it and permanently turning it into a swamp. This is part of why you cannot successfully defend a town that Strahd wants to destroy...he can turn the environment against it. (Flood Vallaki, take Krezk out with an avalanche, etc)</li><li>Strahd technically owns everything in the entire valley; he does not need an invitation to enter a home. This is a trump card for him, though--and not something he reveals lightly. Also, he still maintains some noble sensibilities--it's rude to just barge into someone's home without an invitation.</li></ul><h2>Creative Tactics</h2><p>Because of Strahd's capabilities, he has tactical options not available to your average enemy...particularly when he is acting as a commander.</p><h3>Fun and Games with Beucephalus</h3><p>Beucephalus, despite getting only an extremely minor mention in the book, is incredibly useful...as such, I upgraded him a bit in my game. Strahd put forth the effort to acquire Barding for the horse, upping its AC to 18. So, given this, lets look at some options...</p><ul><li>Strahd is faster than you: With a mount that flies at 90', Strahd is the fastest moving thing in the valley apart from the Rok. He can easily beat the party to any location he wants to beat them to.</li><li>Perfect Infiltration: Beucephalus can transport Strahd and/or several minions via the Ethereal Plane into otherwise-impossible-to-access locations and drop them off. It is impossible for them to be seen coming.</li><li>Perfect Ambush: Can move allied creatures into an ambush location, then they all Ready Actions to attack the moment the are shifted to the Material.</li><li>Tactical repositioning: Beucephalus can pull allies into the Ethereal, relocate them, then pop back into the Material with them on the next round. This allows him to move allied creatures past choke points, barricades, and other obstacles. This can be paired with the 'Perfect Ambush' option to dogpile a vulnerable character.</li><li>It's raining monsters: This takes some prep-work, but Beucephalus can be used to lead a parade of creatures through the Ethereal to points near the PCs. Beucephalus then goes from point to point, popping these monsters back to the Material Plane, delivering a moderate force to a location without any sign of their approach. Easily usable to fill houses with monsters to all come pouring out to attack the PCs once the time is right. For a bit of hilarity, make this literal. The monsters all stand above the combat point, and Beucephalus starts transporting them back to the Material, allowing them to literally rain down on the PCs.</li></ul><p>Using Beucephalus is not without risks. If he is destroyed then any creatures presently on the Ethereal are stranded there. This is another good reason for Strahd to have devil-summoning spells, as he may get stranded on the Ethereal and need to temporarily summon up another Nightmare to get himself out. An alternative possibility is to make it that Beucephalus cannot be properly killed...if killed, Strahd can resummon it in 24 hours. Pulling in a magic item from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (Infernal Tack) could be used with this--if you want to get rid of Beucephalus, you need to get the spurs that summon him and bind him to Strahd. Without them, he can't summon the Nightmare (and if you're evil...maybe now you can).</p><h3>Confusion Tactics</h3><p>If Strahd gets to prepare the battlefield, perhaps he sets some things up in advance.</p><ul><li>Illusory Terrain to hide natural or unnatural (like pit traps) perils</li><li>Cast Seeming to disguise creatures as something they aren't. This could be anything from making monsters look like normal people, to making them look like other sorts of monster. Ghouls disguised as Zombies, Skeletons disguised as Vampire Spawn (see how fast the PCs run). Disguising a mob of undead as a mob of bandits may trick the party's divine casters into not attempting to Turn them...or vice versa, getting the divine caster to waste an Action trying to Turn humanoids.</li><li>Illusory body doubles. Illusion spells can be used to make a minion look like him, or himself look like one of his minions. As a 'cheating to get out of defeat free' aside...in the event that your PCs get off a bunch of lucky crits and 'lay Strahd out,' you could always retroactively decide that they took out a illusion-cloaked body double, not the real thing. Or use it for a bait and switch...throw a Vampire Spawn magicked to look like Strahd at them and let them kill it. While the PCs stand there going 'wtf, that was it?' the real thing pops up and flattens the party.</li><li>Employ the use of bait--fake and legitimate. Charm, Suggest, or Force random innocents into positions that will draw the PCs into a trap. Or polymorph a monster into looking like an innocent for the same purposes.</li></ul><p>Playing with Charm</p><p>A vampire's charm is very powerful, but has its limits. While you see Strahd as your dear friend and are incapable of trying to do him harm--it doesn't mean you aren't still friends with the other PCs. If he's going to Charm you into betraying your friends, he has to make them not your friends first. However, Strahd does not have to be in humanoid form to use Charm. Charming people as a bat is perfectly functional.</p><ul><li>Charm the bearer of the Sunsword. Politely ask them to turn it off, as it is hurting him. Then, unleash some sob-story about how that sword belonged to his dearly beloved brother and he has been looking for it for ages and oh wouldn't the PC let him return the sword to his brother's grave. It would give him so much closure to have finally recovered the last of his brother's most precious belongings. (Note: Nothing said in that statement is a lie as long as Strahd takes the sword back to his brother's grave before trying to destroy it.)</li><li>Pre-Charm some PCs before a fight breaks out. Enjoy the chaos as members of the party are trying to break up the fight rather than trying to kill him.</li><li>Charm a PC then use Sending or Rary's Telepathic Bond to send them secret messages and instructions.</li><li>Have conversations with Charmed PCs. Plant ideas in their heads that their other 'friends' don't appreciate them. Or that they don't trust them.</li><li>Remember that Charm works on NPCs, too. He can Charm an otherwise neutral NPC into trying to break up a fight or fighting on his side so the PCs end up either killing an innocent person, or being paranoid about whether or not any humanoid they are fighting against is actually doing it of their own will and always going for non-lethal. Couple this with Illusions for extra chaos.</li></ul><h2>Making Strahd seem omniscient (without cheating)</h2><p>One of the scariest things about Strahd, in my mind, is when the players start to believe he is all-knowing. When they start to believe that he truly is the land, and that they can't hide their actions from him. In truth, Strahd is not all-knowing--but he likes people to think he is. While it is fully possible to just cheat and make Strahd know things, I find it more fun to look at how he can actually seem omniscient</p><ul><li>Use Detect Thoughts to have Strahd finish people's sentences for them. Or have him ask them questions, then he vocalizes the answer to that question if they don't respond.</li><li>Pair Charm with Modify Memory to interview characters (PCs and NPCs) without their knowledge. Strahd Charms them, asks them questions for less than 10 minutes, then wipes the event from their memory. He could gain some extremely personal information about PCs this way.</li><li>Spies. Spies everywhere. They don't even have to be malicious or even all that active--they don't need to follow the players around or act suspicious. They might just be some rando Barovian that got an unpleasant visit and offered something (even if that something was \"I won't feed you to my wolves\") in exchange for reporting anything they happen to learn about Outsiders. Most Barovians are flatly terrified of Strahd--it wouldn't be hard at all for him to press some into service for little things like that.</li><li>When scrying, choose your targets cleverly. If the PCs are hanging out with someone who serves Strahd, target that person (as they'll auto-fail voluntarily). If your party travels with animals (like horses), target them instead of a PC. It's a lot easier to get hair from the party's horse while it's in a stable than it is to get hair from a PC. Still, try to get a lock of hair (or other sheddable body-part, like scales) from each PC. If the PCs all go down in a fight...perhaps rather than making it a TPK, they all wake up with missing bits of hair.</li><li>Spies on the Ethereal Plane. Strahd has Beucephalus pop a minion onto the Ethereal Plane and has them follow the party around for a while. Perhaps he always has a spy camping them from the Ethereal, and they just rotate out to go back and report to him.</li><li>Moles. The book tends to call out that humanoids allied to Strahd are pretty open about their allegiance. This is dumb. Sure, maybe some of them are all rah-rah-Strahd-forever! But some are certainly aware that they can better serve their master if their allegiance is secret. Have individuals who are servants of Strahd be friendly--have them lie about their allegiance (or tell an 'exact words' falsehood where the words they say are technically true, but intended to mislead). Do stuff that aids the PCs but doesn't hamper Strahd (much). Then they can happily report to Strahd all the information that the PCs freely give them, because they trust them now. In my game, I did this with the Vistani near Vallaki. The PCs like them and quite trust Luvash (finding him to be a very entertaining character because he's this massive thug-looking guy who is obviously wrapped around his daughter's finger) to the point of letting him sneak them into Vallaki and watch their horse while they are in there. Naturally, Luvash has acquired some horse-hair for his master's scrying spells at this point.</li></ul><h3>Effects of this</h3><ul><li>If the party comes up with some sort of pass-phrase or sign to prove it's really them, check to see if they are being observed when they decide on it. If so, Strahd now knows the 'trick' they came up with to confirm their identity.</li><li>Strahd is not surprised by plans or tricks that the players come up with. If they sit around working out a strategy for fighting him, he knows what their plan is. In fact, he may develop plans specifically to counter them.</li><li>If a planned deception was discussed out loud by the PCs, Strahd knows about it. The only way to have a real chance at deceiving him is to do it off-the-cuff, or at least never discuss it out loud.</li></ul><p>There are countermeasures to this, but your players will have to figure them out...if they realize what's happening in the first place.</p><h2>Stages of Interest</h2><p>In my game, I gauge Strahd's current interest in the party in 5 levels. The more attention Strahd is paying to you, the more dangerous your life becomes.</p><h3>Stage 1: Aware</h3><p>The party has only recently arrived in Barovia and hasn't done anything of note yet. Strahd is aware that they exist because he is aware of anyone who enters his domain, but isn't paying much attention to them. Basically, they need to prove they aren't just going to bite it the first time a couple zombies jump them before he's going to bother paying attention. At this point...</p><ul><li>Strahd continues business as normal. If the party encounters him at this point, it's coincidental--he was somewhere doing something, and they just happened to be there at the same time. The Feast of St. Andrals is an example of such a potential encounter.</li><li>Vistani and other allies of Strahd will report to him anything they learn about the PCs, but Strahd is making no special effort to investigate them.</li><li>If they encounter creatures Strahd controls, he is not commanding them.</li></ul><h3>Stage 2: Interested</h3><p>The party has performed some unexpected or impressive feat (thwarting a plan, killing a powerful creature, acquiring a relic, etc.) and Strahd has deemed them worth his attention. At this point, he is primarily gathering information.</p><ul><li>Spies start trying to steal a personal effect or bit of hair from the PCs to boost the efficacy of Strahd's Scrying spell. Randomly call for Wisdom saves from the party to represent his attempts to scry on them (definitely don't tell them why they are saving).</li><li>If a PC is isolated at some point, Strahd may attempt to interview them. He approaches them in bat form and tries to Charm them. If successful, he takes humanoid form and has a chat. He wants to know more about them and their companions, and asks questions to that effect. He keeps the interview short, then tries to use Modify Memory to wipe the conversation from the PC's head. In play, simply call for Wisdom Saves from the isolated player and don't tell anyone anything if they fail both (perhaps tell the player outside of the game if you want to let them RP out their (forgotten) discussion with Strahd. Strahd can use the same trick on NPCs that the party is friendly with.</li><li>Strahd will observe the party in combat while invisible/ethereal/as a bat/etc. He may throw a mixed or buffed unit at them and command it, just to see how they fare.</li><li>This is when Strahd sends them the invitation to dinner. I recommend having a look at elven tower's guide on Dinner with Strahd, as it is much better than what's in the book.</li><li>If you plan to plant a Strahd-serving mole in the party, now's the time.</li></ul><h3>Stage 3: Active Interference</h3><p>Strahd has gathered enough information, and now it's time to have fun. This is the stage that Strahd will be in for most of the adventure. He is seeking to corrupt the PCs, manipulate them into helping him bypass whatever it is that is keeping him from Ireena, break their spirits, or whatever else he deems suitable for a given PC. This will be broken up into two parts...</p><p>Changes to life for the party</p><ul><li>Enemies should behave more intelligently and mixed units should start becoming more common. However, more intelligent creatures may intentionally leave downed creatures alive (deal non-lethal KO damage), because Strahd isn't done with them yet</li><li>Strahd himself may pick fights with them, just to kick them around a bit. Always have multiple escape plans in mind.</li><li>Strahd's pyschological warfare goals are primarily focused on sowing distrust and paranoia among the PCs. If a particular PC seems susceptible to betraying their friends, he focuses on isolating that character. Additionally, if he can get them to do something 'evil' then points to him.</li></ul><p>Example ideas for ways Strahd may interact</p><p> </p><ul><li>Strahd gives the party a quest. The quest is to do something that is objectively good (such as saving children from Old Bonegrinder/Werewolves or restoring the winery). He doesn't really care if they succeed or not, he just wants to see what they'll do. Do they refuse the quest because of its source? Are they second-guessing themselves the whole way? Do they do the opposite of what he asked them to do?</li><li>Strahd continues information gathering. If he catches a PC or allied NPC alone, he does the same he did during Stage 2, but may also bite them as well. That way, they go back to the party with a bite mark on their neck and no knowledge of how it got there. Which a paranoid party may take as a sign of untrustworthiness or outright collusion.</li><li>Charm a party member or allied NPC, then use Sending or a pre-established Rary's Telepathic Bond to get them to do suspicious things or things harmful to the party. As Strahd does not need to be in humanoid form to Charm targets, he can establish the Charm as a bat.</li><li>Use Seeming to 'replace' someone (or multiple someones). For example, sneak into the Blue Water Inn and temporarily incapacitate the Martikovs and some or all of the patrons. Replace them with cultists (for anyone the party needs to talk to) and undead, all masked into looking 'normal' with Seeming. When the party realizes something is off, attack. Seeming doesn't drop just because combat started, so this will cause all manner of chaos. For extra fun, have a few genuinely uninvolved innocents mixed in there, just to see if the freaked out PCs end up killing innocent bystanders.</li><li>Use Seeming on the party--make them look like monsters or Vampire Spawn. Enjoy the fact that they are stuck out in the wilderness for the night, or getting attacked by allies. Or even other PCs.</li><li>Alternately, Strahd can use Disguise Self or Alter Self to personally replace an individual for the purpose of talking with the PCs--he may even replace a PC for a short while. For example, if he catches a PC alone he can incapacitate them and hand them off to a minion. He takes their form and returns to the party, and continues along with them for a short while. In a short while, they happen upon a coffin lying in the road...just as they arrive, the actual PC wakes up inside the coffin. Strahd lets the \"who is the real one!?\" drama play out for a moment, then drops the disguise, thanks the party for their company, and departs.</li><li>Strahd sends a PC a bag of money with a note, thanking them for some obscure 'service.'</li><li>Strahd may start making subtle overtures towards a PC he thinks he can corrupt</li><li>Adopt a disguised 'role' that he plays, and be friendly with the NPCs.</li><li>Try to get the PCs to dislike/distrust the actual decent people in the valley and make friends with Strahd's servants. (In my game so far, the PCs are very buddy-buddy with the Vistani that live outside Vallaki). In the case of the Vistani, make up some BS about how Strahd has a non-aggression pact with them as part of their 'we can come and go freely from Barovia.' Make them think that their Vistani 'allies' are the only folk in the valley that are 'safe' from Strahd. NOTE: Strahd's servants are smart enough to keep their true allegiance a secret.</li></ul><h3>Stage 4: Break Them</h3><p>Strahd is ready to start breaking his toys now. Continue anything he was doing in Stage 3, but turn it up to 11.</p><ul><li>If Strahd has found a PC he can isolate from the rest, his goal with them is to make it so that this person dislikes their 'allies' enough that, while charmed, he can command them to turn on their friends. Perhaps even get them to do it voluntarily.</li><li>Capitalize on any seeds of distrust and paranoia planted in Stage 3. Make note of what worked and what didn't, and double down on the points that worked.</li><li>Strahd begins using creative combat tactics (see below) on a regular basis, and many foes will be under his command. He may even directly lead strike teams to harm the party.</li><li>Additional example ideas for how Strahd may interact</li><li>Dominate someone the party likes and force them to attack the party</li><li>Make offers to the party (such as 'Bring me Ireena and I'll let you leave.'). If possible, manipulate/lie about the results of agreement or disagreement.</li><li>Allow them to find a suit of armor...either the presently-inert Animated Armor in the Tower of Khazan, or Strahd's Animated Armor. The armor has been throughly worked over with Nystul's Magic Aura to hide its true nature. Let them enjoy the armor...then, in the final battle, activate the armor.</li><li>Spread rumors to lead PCs to cursed items (such as the Staff of Frost in the Amber Temple) that may corrupt them</li><li>Manipulate someone (non-evil) into setting the Assassin bound to the magic mirror on one of the PCs. Charm them while in disguise and lie to them about what the mirror does (tell them it will summon a spectral warrior to go to the PCs' aid if they speak the rhyme and say a PC's name.)</li><li>If the Revenants at Argynvostholt are still around, see to it that they find out the PCs are aiming to kill Strahd.</li><li>Use Dream to harass a PC, hiding the fact that Strahd is sending the dream. If targeting a Cleric or Paladin, make it seem like a Dream from their deity, informing them that Strahd cannot be killed, they can only seek to redeem him. Or that Strahd must live on and suffer, rather than being killed. Alternately, give them a Dream about Madame Eva sending them an 'extra prophecy' to aid them along their way. In short, give them dreams that give them disruptive/false information.</li><li>If the PCs have experience with Strahd replacing people, use Suggestion to get an NPC the PCs know well to behave in a way that is out of character for them...see if the PCs' paranoia fires off and makes them harm/kill a friend.</li><li>Use Seeming to make innocents look like monsters, try to get the PCs to attack them. Drop the spell after about half of them are dead.</li><li>If the party has acquired any of the Relics, use trickery and other people to try to take it from them.</li><li>Spread copious amounts of misinformation throughout the valley. Rumors that the sunsword is cursed to gradually overtake the mind of its wielder, that overuse of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind will turn you into a Raven, that one of the PCs or someone they know was seen conversing with a vampire spawn in the middle of the night (when the rest of the party was in bed), rumors of powerful useful things in the mountains to the North, rumors of a cult in Krezk, and so on. Just make up a bunch of bull-crap and spread it around. The best part with this is that no Insight check can prove these false...because the PCs are hearing this information second or third-hand, likely from someone who believes it to be true...Insight or even Zone of Truth doesn't help you against someone who is simply wrong.</li></ul><h3>Stage 5: Obliterate</h3><p>The party is too dangerous to be left alive or has enraged Strahd. He wants them dead. The gloves are off. However, Strahd is still a highly intelligent and successful general. He's not going to just hurl himself at them in a wild fury and immediately fight to the death. No, he's going to wear them down and deplete their resources--so that when he goes for the kill, it's easy. This is how you force the final confrontation...the PCs' best move is to go on the offensive as soon as possible--the longer they wait around while Strahd is doing this, the harder their life is going to become.</p><ul><li>Strahd is done playing. If he thinks a PC can be corrupted, he makes his move. If not, they die.</li><li>Strahd knows how dangerous the PCs have become and begins using attrition-style warfare to wear them down. Attacks against the PCs are always conducted with a goal in mind: Kill that character, acquire that item, destroy that location, etc. Strahd can always make more undead, he can always turn new Vampire Spawn. If he sacrifices a half-dozen Spawn and a large number of zombies to get his hands on the Sunsword or kill a single PC, that counts as a win in his book.</li><li>Strahd begins destroying the PCs' network of allies. If possible, he kills these NPCs in front of the PCs (Wall of Force/Drain them dry, for example). Once the PCs realize what is going on and start avoiding their allies, they start getting reports that their friends are all being killed. NPCs with a shakier relationship with the PCs may turn on them to try to protect themselves.</li><li>If Strahd has a mole among them, now is the time to strike.</li><li>Strahd seeks to compromise or destroy their base of operations. He wants them isolated and exhausted.</li><li>Strahd is more careful in combat, especially if the party has Sunlight-producing relics. He may avoid the front lines, using his forces instead of taking the field directly.</li><li>Strahd's targeting of their allies and safe places is aimed at demoralizing them as well as destroying assets. Killed allies should be killed horribly and/or turned into Vampires/Undead to be used against the PCs. If the resulting undead is capable of speech, then they should be forced to curse and scream at the PCs, blaming them for what was done to them.</li><li>If the PCs have made 'friends' with any of Strahd's servants, now is the time for a precision-strike betrayal. Attack them in their sleep, poison their food, whatever hurts the most.</li></ul><h2>The Final Battle</h2><p>So, here we are. The party has gathered their artifacts, rallied themselves, and marched on Castle Ravenloft. So, how do we make this a Battle worthy of Legends? Strahd is...not actually that durable. In the face of the Sunsword, the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, St. Markovia's Thighbone, and the Icon of Ravenloft...if Strahd tries to fight them straight up, he's going to go down like a chump. So, here we go...</p><p>Disclaimer: if you completely follow my advice here, you're probably headed for a TPK. Pick the pieces you like and implement them (or go whole hog and TPK em, up to you)</p><h3>Prepare for them</h3><p>Strahd knows they are coming. Of course he knows. So, let's get ready for them.</p><ul><li>Swap out his spell list. The spells listed in his statblock are what I consider his day-to-day overlording loadout. If he's going to war, he should switch out for more appropriate spells. Consider where your party is set to have their Final Battle with Strahd, and pick whatever spells off the Wizard spell list are the most advantageous. (For example, Gust of Wind is kind of useless in the crypts...but if he's fighting them on top of the castle, punting the party off the side is awesome).</li><li>If the party includes a Paladin or other caster with a Detect Evil/Divine Sense capability, prepare and Cast Nystul's Magic Aura on himself. Change his apparent creature type to humanoid to confound their spell.</li><li>Wear the party down. If the party shows up to battle Strahd and is at full strength, he didn't do his job right. You have an army. Use it.</li><li>Gear up. If you want drama, let Strahd summon it onto himself as a Bonus Action...but if Strahd's Armor is still around, he puts it on. This gives him an even higher AC, immunity to lightning damage, and a lightning-based ranged attack. And a lightning-damage dealing sword, if he wants to use that instead of his claws. (For fun...have him hold off on doing this for a bit...where he just plays with the PCs like a big cat. Then he goes \"I suppose that's enough playing around. Time to die.\" :Snaps his fingers and armor materializes around him:)</li><li>As DM, study the area he will be fighting them in. What's around it, above it, below it? Where can Strahd go to buy himself a few rounds to recover? Look at the Battle section below and figure out how Strahd plans to tackle this.</li></ul><h3>The Battle</h3><p>Go time. Note that some of these recommendations may contradict the number of spell slots he has (such as suggesting using Seeming but also suggesting using Wall of Force, despite the fact that he only has the one 5th level spell slot). This is to give options to you.</p><ul><li>Action Economy disparity sucks. Crowd Control is Strahd's friend. Polymorph, Hypnotic Pattern, Wall of Force, and anything else that takes PCs out of the fight tilts things in his favor. The fewer attacks being leveled at him per round, the better.</li><li>Kite your enemies. Strahd can walk through walls to put stout stone between himself and sunlight-producing artifacts, and can lure the PCs to chase him...either into other enemies, or into traps. Strahd knows where all his traps are, of course...so why wouldn't he lead the PCs into them? Remember, Strahd has Spider Climb and can go through floors and ceilings. Doing this also gives him time out of sunlight in order to regenerate HP.</li><li>Abuse Seeming to devour party resources. Strahd can make an arbitrarily large number of minions look like him before the PCs show up. Have decoy Strahds all over the place...use them as sacrificial pawns to lure the party to bad places. For extra evil...when the party finds Strahd at the appointed location, they are likely to open big. Unload on him with everything they've got to try to Alpha him down. So, have the 'Strahd' they find be a Vampire Spawn under Seeming. They nuke 'Strahd' and blow all their best tricks...likely reducing the spawn to dust. The party stands there for a second going \"Um...is that it?\" Then Strahd's laughter starts echoing through the room and he either suckerpunches someone from behind, or several more 'Strahds' show up (maybe one of them is even the real thing!)</li><li>Charm people. Pre-emptively, if possible. Convincing the Fighter or Paladin to hand over the Sunsword, or pitch it off the side of the castle is a great way to get rid of a serious hazard to your health.</li><li>Target Priority. In my experience, it's sort of common for DMs to 'play along' and have the monsters fight the martial characters for the most part. Strahd's not an idiot, though...what's the point of playing around with the walking ball of armor when the squishy wizard is blowing him up, or the healer is undoing his efforts to murder you. Pick your targets based on who it would hurt the party the most to lose.</li><li>Isolate Sunlight wielders. These are the most directly dangerous foes, as they produce an aura that hurts you, blocks your regen, AND prevents you from going Mist-form if you are defeated. Polymorph them, enclose them in a cubic Wall of Stone, lock them in rooms by themselves, use minions to knock them into traps</li><li>Separate the party. Strahd can close and lock doors as a lair action. If his lair action comes up and the party is divided between rooms with a door in between them...slam the door shut and lock it, then suckerpunch whichever half of the party is the most vulnerable (or painful to lose).</li><li>Exploit your speed. If Strahd is going full-out, he can cover 150' in a round. (Move, Dash, LA-movex3). Nobody can catch him when he wants to outpace you.</li><li>Exploit your absurd stealth check. Given that Strahd can pass through walls and outrun everyone, breaking line of sight is easy. Strahd should be striking from Stealth on a regular basis. The party should not 'catch' Strahd, he should loop around and suckerpunch them while they are chasing him. Of note: Strahd can use Lair Actions without breaking stealth. Go sneaky, then use the Specter and Shadow Lair Actions to reduce HP and Str values across the party. Prioritize with the Shadows, of course...aim for the Str-dependent characters.</li><li>If you can go outside onto the rooftops or ramparts, enjoy the fact that the weather is on Strahd's side. For a climactic encounter like this, there should be a full-blown thunderstorm on. The rain should limit visibility and make perilous footing (like the rooftops) even more dangerous. Strahd's spider climb lets him basically ignore the perilous footing.</li><li>Ration your Legendary Resistances. Turn Undead is not a big deal. Accept the turning, activate the 'walk through walls' lair action, then leave the party feeling foolish while Strahd runs off to go regenerate all his hitpoints, and a party member is down a Channel Divinity. You can always flee to regen health as well, so unless it would put him dangerously close to death, don't worry about failing saves vs. damage. No, the big threats are the ones that prevent Strahd from moving. As long as Strahd can move, he can put a solid object between himself and the PCs and can regenerate health. (Tactically, your best option to beat Strahd like this is to pop Wall of Force to make a box trapping him and you in one place.)</li><li>Bring in allies. If there are still enemies in the castle, call them in or lead the party to them. Certainly Rahadin would spring to his master's aid if he knew Strahd was under attack.</li><li>Try to lead the party away from your crypt. If Strahd is killed and isn't in sunlight when he dies, he turns to mist and flows back to his coffin. Once he gets there, you have 1 hour to finish him off or he regains consciousness, then rapidly regenerates all his hitpoints (regeneration feature starts working again). And you're back to square one.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, the final battle with Strahd should range all over the castle. The more the party has explored and cleared the castle before fighting Strahd, the less likely they are to die horribly. Strahd won't have many allies left to lead them to and the party should have figured out where the traps are. You could even have it that allies of the party who have survived up to this point get involved in little ways. As an off-the-cuff example...suppose Strahd convinced someone to pitch the Sunsword off the side of the castle. At a dramatically appropriate moment, one of the Keepers of the Feather (in Raven form) drops the sword in a PC's hands.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, there you have it. My notes on playing Strahd. Enjoy! (I have another pair of these in the works...one on Ezmerelda, one on Ireena.)</p>"},"_id":"lfdVLL5BtSUGUWzQ","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Developing Strahd's Pursuit of Ireena","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>In @JournalEntry[7BR85GbIQ4vXzo04]{Unholy Terror}, /u/guildsbounty did an incredible job of discussing the mentality, skills, and strategies of Strahd von Zarovich. This post (seriously; go read it) neatly answers one of the two eternal questions that plague DMs running Curse of Strahd: \"Why, exactly, does Strahd not just kill the PCs now?\"</p><p>With that said, there is a second question that harries us DMs of CoS. Strahd is a tactician, but he is also a lover. If he knows where Ireena is, knows the strength of her protectors, and is capable of retrieving her - then why does he not simply take her in Session 3?</p><p>This post attempts to answer that question by discussing the four \"stages\" of Strahd's perspective on Ireena. Note that not all four stages are necessarily reached in all campaigns, but given the dynamics of the Curse of Strahd module, I certainly expect DMs to reach Stage 4 in a large majority of campaigns. These stages are largely independent of the \"Stages of Interest\" discussed by /u/guildsbounty, but it is quite likely that the two timelines will correlate as they develop, if only due to the way the module is structured.</p><p>Disclaimer: The following post discusses an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. If you or any of your players may be disturbed or made uncomfortable by exploring Strahd's obsession with Ireena to this depth, I advise dialing his romantic interests back, or even eliminating that plot altogether.</p><h2>Stage 1: Courting</h2><p>In this stage, Strahd is interested in getting Ireena to fall for him willingly. He disguises himself as Vasili von Holtz in effort to get closer to her - and perhaps make her fall in love with his alter-ego - and sends her frequent gifts through proxies. He is wary of making a move upon her too soon, as he knows that the Dark Powers will intervene as soon as he does. He believes that if Tatyana loves him wholeheartedly, he has a better chance of keeping her for his own.</p><h2>Stage 2: Isolating</h2><p>Once Strahd realizes that Ireena will never love him naturally, Strahd sets out to manipulate her affections and loyalties. He believes that if she is bereft of a support network, she will soon become lonely or desperate enough to turn to him - the one stable thing left in her life. In this phase, Strahd attempts to poison Ireena's allies against her, and works to render each sanctuary she finds uninhabitable, while doing his best to portray Castle Ravenloft as a place of safety and warmth.</p><h2>Stage 3: Threatening</h2><p>Once Ireena moves to a physical or emotional point beyond Strahd's reach, either through the power of her allies or through her own hostility to his efforts, Strahd snaps, and turns to forceful measures. Reasoning that the Dark Powers will not step in so long as he does not approach Tatyana directly, Strahd threatens, torments, and tortures Ireena's friends, allies, and protectors in an effort to force her to come to him to save their lives and livelihoods.</p><h2>Stage 4: Attacking</h2><p>Once he realizes that Ireena has nothing left to lose, or that there is nothing he can do to cajole her into joining him, Strahd takes the gloves off. He no longer cares for the possibility of the Dark Powers' intervention, reasoning that if she dies, he can simply court Tatyana in a future reincarnation. He makes every effort to kidnap and turn Tatyana by subterfuge and by force.</p><p>If and when Strahd finally gets his claws on Ireena, he swiftly turns her, sending out invitations to their wedding celebration soon after. Note that, unless you play Ireena and Strahd in a far different manner from their book characterizations, Strahd will never achieve his goal in Stages 1 or 2, but may succeed in Stage 3, and will almost always succeed in Stage 4 due to his vast power and resources.</p><p>It is in some ways a foregone conclusion that Ireena is doomed in the vast majority of all campaigns. Even so, remember that the Dark Powers will never allow Strahd to seal his partnership with Tatyana. Whether it is by suicide, homicide, or a simple accident, Strahd's victory will always lead to Ireena's untimely death.</p>"},"_id":"J23gAQeXaYRqXC2R","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.4tnatEHoCkqx6C2i.JournalEntryPage.J23gAQeXaYRqXC2R"}}},{"name":"Combat Tactics","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Do you want to let Strahd ignore the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind? Do you want to make sure he’s never grappled, nullify Counterspell and Telekinesis, and prevent your PCs from ever executing a Divine Smite or a Stunning Strike?</p><p>Do you want to make Strahd immune to sunlight?</p><p>You can do all this and more - without changing Strahd’s RAW statblock or CR. Here’s how.</p><h2>Strahd is Smart</h2><p>With his 20 Intelligence, Strahd is incredibly smart. To give you a reference point, Albert Einstein and Sherlock Holmes almost definitely had 20 INT, making Strahd a proper genius. He’s also nearly five hundred years old and an accomplished warlord, giving him centuries of tactical experience to draw upon in combat.</p><p>As such, Strahd <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">never enters combat without a plan, a backup plan, and an escape route</span></span>. Moreover, these plans are never complicated, and never rely on more than one moving part. He also never enters combat without first gauging his enemies’ strengths, weaknesses, and tactics.</p><p>If you’ve been using Strahd’s spies and Scrying spell correctly, Strahd should swiftly learn what spells the PCs are able to cast, what magic items they have in their possession, and what benefits their class features offer. He should know what strategies they favor (e.g., Does the sorcerer routinely polymorph the monk into a Giant Ape? Does the paladin wait for the wizard to cast Telekinesis before rushing in with a Divine Smite? What animal forms does the druid favor, and how adept is the rogue at picking locks?), and prepare accordingly.</p><p>He’s seen the Sunsword in action before, and his +10 to Religion means that he almost certainly knows what the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind is capable of. Moreover, he’s fought countless adventurers over the centuries. The Barovian March of the Dead alone places the deaths of one hundred adventurers - equivalent to twenty adventuring parties - directly at his hands. He knows the tropes, he knows the popular strategies, and he’s butchered and outmaneuvered them all.</p><p>In short, when running Strahd in combat, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">preparation is king</span></span>. Review your PCs’ character sheets and magic item lists in-depth, and jot down any special abilities or spells that they reveal to Strahd or his spies. Thoroughly review the battlefield (and, if you’re in the castle, its layout) and decide which areas and tactics would offer Strahd the greatest advantage. If, by luck or skill, the PCs manage to force Strahd into a specific battlefield or conceal that they’ve obtained the Holy Symbol or Sunsword, then they deserve to surprise him - but if not, Strahd will never allow them an opportunity to get away with it.</p><h2>Strahd is Mobile</h2><p>To quote Sun Tzu, “You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.” In other words, Strahd will always want to choose his battlefield for maximum success - and with his insanely high mobility, he can do so nearly every time.</p><p>The first element of his mobility is his Legendary Action (Move). His Unarmed Strike and Bite are nice for some extra damage, but the ability to move an additional ninety feet per round without triggering opportunity attacks is incredibly powerful. Between Strahd’s regular movement and his Legendary Actions, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Strahd should never begin his turn within sunlight, and should never end his turn or Legendary Action movements in a position that allows one or more of the PCs to attack him or target him with spells</span></span>. If the cleric’s turn is after the rogue, and the cleric is holding the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, then Strahd will use his Legendary Action immediately after the rogue’s turn to maneuver out of the Holy Symbol’s range.</p><p>(As an aside, make sure that you’re accounting for movement speed. Assuming the cleric has a speed of 30, the true range of the Holy Symbol is sixty feet - thirty feet of movement plus thirty feet of range. Thus, Strahd will either block the cleric from getting within thirty feet via phasing or Spider Climb, or he’ll end his movement at least sixty-five feet away from the cleric’s current position.)</p><p>No matter where he is, Strahd’s Spider Climb feature is one of his most powerful abilities. This allows him to climb up walls, move upside-down on ceilings, scale any building’s exterior, or move across a roof without making an ability check. For example, if Strahd begins on the exterior wall below the Tower Roof (K57), he can use his Spider Climb to climb underneath the bridge, up and around the outside of the Heart of Sorrow’s tower (K20), and into the opening in the North Tower Peak. With his Legendary Actions, he can do it all in a single round - and if he’s hidden in darkness, he can do it all without the PCs ever noticing where he’s gone.</p><p>While within Castle Ravenloft, Strahd’s mobility is multiplied exponentially by his “phasing” Lair Action, which allows him to pass through ceilings, walls, and floors as if they aren’t there. A flexible reading of this would allow him to pass through solid surfaces at any angle and in any direction, floating through the stone of Castle Ravenloft itself for as long as he likes and in any manner he likes. A less charitable (but fairer) interpretation allows him to ignore any single surface, so long as he is still able to move using another surface. For example, he can pass through the ceiling so long as he has a wall to climb up, and he can pass through a wall if he’s walking on the floor or crawling on the ceiling.</p><p>This ability, when combined with Strahd’s Spider Climb, single-handedly makes him one of the most deadly and dangerous villains to fight in his lair. Before running combat in Castle Ravenloft, carefully study the castle layout to identify “hiding places” that Strahd can easily duck in and out of by phasing. If Strahd is on the second floor, for example, a list of good “hiding places” might include the concealed Elevator Shaft (K31A), the High Tower Stair (K18), the Heart of Sorrow (K20), and any number of hidden rooms and other chambers made inaccessible by the castle’s architecture.</p><p>He also has an unparalleled ability to choose his battleground and escape from disadvantaged combats. If your PCs first encounter him in the Audience Hall (K25), he can immediately sink through the floor to the first floor below before the spells start flying. If he first encounters the PCs in the Dining Hall on the first floor, and immediately takes 100 points of damage from a trio of Fireballs, he can phase through the south wall onto the castle grounds, and immediately climb up the exterior of the castle to the Lounge or Tower Roof, taking all the time that he needs to gather allies or regenerate his health.</p><p>While not in sunlight (which should always be the case), Strahd can also shapechange into a bat or wolf. While neither form is especially helpful in Castle Ravenloft, the bat can help him make a quick escape while battling the PCs outside the castle. The bat’s fly speed can allow him to swiftly flee into the skies, far from the reach of any melee PCs, and beyond the reach of sunlight.</p><p>However, Strahd has a strictly better option for escape: his nightmare, Beucephalus. No matter what, whenever Strahd ventures outside of Castle Ravenloft (and even while within the castle itself), he should command Beucephalus to wait in the Ethereal Plane nearby, ready to swoop in and teleport him to safety whenever Strahd is in danger. Notably, creatures on the Ethereal Plane can see faintly into the Material Plane, but creatures on the Material cannot see into the Ethereal, giving Beucephalus a constant element of surprise.</p><p>When combat starts, if he is present, secretly roll initiative for Beucephalus. On its turn, Beucephalus moves adjacent to Strahd (or, using its 10 INT, predicts where Strahd is going to be), and Readies an action to Ethereal Stride into the Material Plane if Strahd is restrained, incapacitated, or grievously wounded. The following turn, Beucephalus maintains contact with Strahd (using its fly speed if necessary to move directly above him), and uses Ethereal Stride a second time to transport the both of them into the Ethereal Plane. This works regardless of whether Strahd is grappled, stunned, or within sunlight, creating the perfect getaway in all situations.</p><h2>Strahd has Allies</h2><p>Beucephalus is but one of many allies that Strahd can all upon, and its Ethereal Stride is good for more than just pulling Strahd to safety. With a single Ethereal Stride, Beucephalus can transport up to three pre-located minions into the battle, potentially including Rahadin, vampire spawn, wights, Barovian witches, or loyal Vistani.</p><p>Rahadin can be an incredibly deadly threat, but especially in difficult terrain or heavy obscurement. His Mask of the Wild ability can allow him to easily strike with surprise alongside Strahd when attacking in the wilderness, and his high Stealth score allows him to conceal himself in the shadows while inside the castle. Moreover, his Deathly Choir ability and Multiattack are great ways to force enemy spellcasters to make additional Concentration checks, eliminating dangerous spells like Hold Person or Telekinesis.</p><p>Don’t forget Strahd’s Children of the Night ability, either. While the swarms he calls upon are fairly worthless offensively, a single swarm of bats can still take the Help action, counteracting disadvantage from sunlight (even against grapples or the Telekinesis spell) or lending Strahd advantage on his next attack. For the biggest impact, use Children of Night shortly before combat, giving the bats a few rounds to arrive and set up.</p><p>Finally, Strahd also has access to several minions, including (as mentioned above) vampire spawn, wights, Barovian witches, and loyal Vistani. While in his castle, Strahd should also make judicious use of existing encounters, luring the PCs onto the Rug of Smothering, unleashing the hell hounds in the catacombs, or activating the Iron Golems in the teleportation room.</p><h2>Strahd is Tough</h2><p>You probably already know this from looking at his statblock, but Strahd is actually surprisingly hardy. He doesn’t have a massive amount of hit points, but his health is supplemented by the Heart of Sorrow. That gives him a nice buffer of fifty hit points - enough to grant him another half-round of survivability if your party manages to get the upper hand on him.</p><p>He has three extremely high saving throws, including a +9 to DEX saving throws, a +7 to WIS saving throws, and a +9 to Charisma saving throws. Both DEX and WIS are two of the most common saving throws against dangerous spells, giving Strahd a reasonably high chance to save against most PC spells and a better-than-even chance of beating the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind’s Hold Vampires ability without even trying.</p><p>With that said, Strahd also has three Legendary Resistances that he can save for last-resort situations. 95% of the time, he should never be in a position where he has to burn a Legendary Resistance to nullify a Stunning Strike or Hold Vampires ability - but if he does, he has three opportunities to get away scot-free. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Strahd will only spend a Legendary Resistance against a spell or ability that aims to incapacitate or immobilize him - otherwise, he relies on his own regeneration to heal any damage from powerful spells.</span></span></p><h2>Strahd is Patient</h2><p>Due to his regeneration, Strahd knows that with<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"> enough time, he can recover from any injury</span></span>. Therefore, he is above all else patient. The PCs have to rest or expend spell slots in order to heal. Strahd can regenerate nearly his entire health pool in under two minutes without any effort.</p><p>As such, Strahd is an expert at whittling enemies down from afar. A single Ray of Frost might not seem like much - but the tenth such attack will leave your squishy mage bloodied. If the PCs try to take a short rest in Castle Ravenloft, Strahd can interrupt it with a single Unarmed Strike or Fireball before vanishing into the walls on the same turn. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sooner or later, your PCs will run out of hit points and healing</span></span>. To Strahd, an experienced general and a master tactician, combat is a war of attrition - not a proud “last stand.” He can afford to be patient.</p><p>This patience is only supplemented by Strahd’s incredible +14 Stealth modifier. Remember: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Strahd does not have to attack every round of combat</span></span>. A highly effective strategy might include phasing into a hiding place one turn, taking the Hide Action on the next, then waiting 1d4 (randomized) rounds before attacking with surprise.</p><p>Not only does this give Strahd advantage on his attacks (or counteract the disadvantage created by sunlight or the Icon of Ravenloft), it also allows him to nullify Counterspell (which can only be cast when you see an enemy casting a spell) and preempts readied actions (which can only go off after he makes his presence known by attacking, and which require a Concentration check to maintain if a caster takes damage before casting a readied spell).</p><p>Moreover, by waiting several rounds between attacks, Strahd can force any spellcasters to make a perilous choice: Do they dare ready a spell and allow a precious spell slot to be consumed if Strahd doesn’t appear by the end of the round? Or do they wait until their turn to attack, and never get an opportunity to cast anything at all?</p><h2>Strahd is Deadly</h2><p>Finally, in addition to his high mobility, fast-working regeneration, and solid defenses, Strahd is a general powerhouse. When it comes to quick skirmishes and jabs, Strahd isn’t too prideful to use Ray of Frost as an all-around ranged attack. His Unarmed Strikes Multiattack is highly useful for grappling and isolating a PC, and then savaging them repeatedly while in a safe and closed-off location.</p><p>(In general, don’t waste your time with Strahd’s Bite attack - his regeneration works quicker, and his Unarmed Strike is far more flexible. Save it for unconscious PCs to make sure that they transform into vampire spawn.)</p><p>On top of his melee and ranged capabilities, Strahd is also a top-tier spellcaster. You’re welcome to swap out his spells for others, but his RAW spellbook also has some decent choices. He won’t waste Polymorph on an enemy (and, due to his Shapechanger feature, can't cast it on himself), but he will use it to turn Rahadin into a tyrannosaurus rex (to restrain dangerous melee PCs) or a vampire spawn into a giant coral snake (to stun PCs and potentially inflict an incredibly damaging short-term madness effect for ten whole minutes).</p><p>Animate Objects is also a decent spell. However, given that it consumes Strahd’s only 5th-level spell slot, he can’t cast it on any day that he also wants to cast Scrying. Additionally, he’ll make sure not to cast it within Counterspell range, and he won’t use it at all if there’s a PC capable of casting Dispel Magic with the party. When he does cast it, though, he’ll usually choose to animate ten Small-sized torches or swords, using them to gang up on a single vulnerable enemy while also trapping that enemy in place (since creatures can’t move through squares occupied by enemies of similar size).</p><p>Finally, Strahd’s most powerful spell is - what else? - Fireball. It can’t be dispelled, and he can easily cast it from hiding, nullifying the threat of Counterspell entirely. He has no other 3rd-level spells worth using, and he’ll rarely cast Polymorph more than once per day, leaving an incredible five spell slots to use for Fireball. He’ll only cast it if he can hit 75% or more of the party in one shot, but that’s still an average of 147 damage per character over five rounds (or ten rounds, assuming Strahd takes the Hide action to reset his stealth every other turn).</p><p>Using his Lair Action to close and lock windows and doors, Strahd can also easily isolate individual PCs that wander away from the group. Use his Legendary Actions to move beside an errant druid or wizard that separate from the party, and then use his Lair Actions to trap them inside. Once a PC is trapped, use Unarmed Strikes or Charm (depending on the PC’s Wisdom saving throw modifier) to deal with them. (Admittedly, this isn’t much use against a party that includes a rogue or the Knock spell, but it’s otherwise a fairly solid strategy for picking off his enemies one-by-one.)</p><p>In short: if the PCs split up, lock them up and pick them off or charm them individually. If they cluster together, blast them with Fireball until there’s nothing left but cinders.</p><p>Either way, Strahd comes out on top.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>In conclusion, Strahd is an intelligent, savage, highly mobile, and high-toughness villain with a great deal of patience and a great deal of allies. When preparing to run him in combat, make sure you’ve answered each of the questions on this checklist:</p><ul><li>Have I thoroughly researched my PCs’ capabilities and prepared countermeasures?</li><li>Have I thoroughly researched my PCs’ weaknesses and found ways to capitalize on them?</li><li>Have I chosen the battlefield carefully and planned a way to use it to my advantage?</li><li>Have I accounted for all of the allies that Strahd could call upon in battle?</li><li>Am I confident that Strahd can remain outside of the range of dangerous spells and abilities at all times?</li><li>Does Strahd have an accessible safe place to take shelter in - or, barring that, does he have a quick escape route in the form of Beucephalus?</li><li>Do I have a plan for spending Legendary Resistances, and do I know when it’s worth Strahd’s while to use one?</li><li>Does Strahd have a safe and quiet place to hide or retreat to in between rounds?</li><li>Do I have a plan to separate the PCs, or to Fireball them to death if they cluster together?</li></ul><p>If the answer to any of these questions is “No,” Strahd flat-out won’t enter combat (unless forced to by external actors or emotional manipulation).</p><h3>Additional Comments</h3><p><strong>The Problem with High CR</strong>: More than one Strahd rework has attempted to counter sunlight and grapples by drastically buffing him. These buffs include doubled hit points, extra turns, magical weapons, sunlight immunity, greater ability scores/proficiency bonuses, and more high-level spell slots. The most notable of these is the infamous CR27 Strahd, which is more powerful than Orcus.</p><p>While I can understand the appeal of buffing Strahd’s Challenge Rating to better counter your party’s strengths, I highly discourage it. The purpose of items like the Sunsword and Holy Symbol of Ravenkind exist to give your PCs a fun, engaging, and trope-y weapon to vanquish a vampire with. If you make Strahd immune to sunlight or prevent your PCs from grappling him, then you are destroying the entire gothic horror fantasy that the module is working to create. Moreover, it strains disbelief to believe that a single four-hundred-year-old vampire lord who rules three small villages could overpower an archangel like a Solar or Planetar, let alone the Demon Prince of Undead himself.</p><p>Moreover, it’s just not necessary. The RAW Strahd, as I’ve found, is more than capable of easily TPKing even veteran parties by himself.</p><p><strong>Playtesting Results</strong>: This method of running Strahd has been previously attempted in the “Strahd Must Die Tonight” community event (more information here). The result was an absolute and almost easy TPK with the PCs dealing little damage to Strahd until the very final scene. Notably, the party included four veteran DMs who pre-planned their strategy and had previously run the Curse of Strahd campaign, which should say something about the power level of these tactics.</p><p><strong>Fine-Tuning Strahd’s Power</strong>: However, that is not to say that you can’t make modifications to this strategy and statblock. As experimental results bear out, it’s almost trivially easy for Strahd to TPK almost any 10th-level party in Castle Ravenloft without any modifications to his statblock. However, you have several (legal, RAW) options for dialing the challenge down or (if you’re feeling especially cruel) further up.</p><h3>Turning Down the Difficulty</h3><ul><li>Instead of attacking and hiding randomly, Strahd attacks in a predictable pattern, appearing either on every turn (easy) or every other turn (less easy).</li><li>Strahd occasionally exposes himself when the Holy Symbol and similar threats aren’t present, allowing PCs to get cast spells or get in some damage.</li><li>Strahd never takes the Hide action, and always attacks in clear sight, allowing readied spells and Counterspells to go off.</li><li>Strahd is emotionally vulnerable and/or prideful, allowing taunts, insinuations of cowardice, his own bloodlust, or threats of violence toward Ireena to provoke him into stepping into the open.</li><li>Strahd replaces Fireball with Lightning Bolt or a similarly low-powered evocation spell.</li></ul><h3>Turning Up the Heat</h3><ul><li>Swap out Strahd’s less-impressive spells, such as Mirror Image, Comprehend Languages, Nondetection, or Animate Dead for more powerful combat-suited ones, such as Fire Shield, Blindness/Deafness, Misty Step, and Shield.</li><li>Add Dispel Magic and Counterspell to Strahd’s spellbook</li><li>Exchange Animate Objects for Seeming and disguise several vampire spawn and Strahd zombies as Strahd (to draw out the PCs’ strongest attacks), while also disguising Strahd as a Barovian villager or party ally (e.g., Ismark).</li><li>Let Strahd wear Strahd’s Animated Armor, raising his AC to 18 and allowing the armor to attack on its own turn.</li></ul><h2>Wrap-Up</h2><p>So that’s it for Strahd’s battle tactics! I’ll likely wrap this into my Curse of Strahd: Reloaded guide at some point, but after the Strahd Must Die Tonight competition, I got bit by inspiration and wanted to get this out ASAP.</p><p>Have you used any of these kinds of tactics successfully in your own campaign?

This is a day to celebrate.</p><p>I was hoping you would live long enough to witness my plans. Pity.</p><p>This is going to be easier than I thought.</p><p>You remind me of my brother.</p><p>Not one of your best days. If I were you, I would start making the most of them.</p><p>You should have turned back when you had the chance.</p><p>If a lord does not mete out justice, who will?</p><p>The life of a thing is in its blood.</p><p>Your life is not worth the worms that shall devour it.</p><p>I would wager you never expected it to end this way. Perhaps you should have.</p><p>I always deal fairly with my guests; you shall get what you deserve.</p><p>The Land is engorged with justice.</p><p>See that you die with dignity; it is more than can be said for most.</p><p>This shall end the only way it can.</p><p>Dinner is served.</p><p>Do you hear them crying out \"villain\" and \"devil\"? They speak not of me.</p><p>Your blood shall run as cold as mine.</p><p>Murder ought to turn your stomach, but it is geting easier, is it not?</p><p>Take heart, little ones. I shall watch over you while you sleep.</p><p>So you fail to live up to expectations; how predictable.</p><p>I already knew I was beyond you. Now you have proven it.</p><p>The mists fell about you like a funeral shroud, and in that moment Barovia became your tomb.</p><p>I am a patient man, but the days of your wickedness are numbered.</p><p>Perhaps I shall let Ceithlenn keep your teeth.</p><p>Luck is a funny thing. For it to run out, there has to be some first.</p><p>My condolences on the losses you have suffered. I am nothing if not sympathetic.</p><p>Tell me, does it hurt terribly?</p><p>Death is cold.</p><p>The time has come to prove yourself, friend. You know what to do.</p><p>No one mourns when the arrogant pass.</p><p>Failure is hardly a surprise at this point.</p><p>And the hunt for my successor goes on.</p><p>There is never nothing to lose.</p><p>Cornered animals make the drollest sounds.</p><p>When you wake, you will be mine.</p><p>I am the late Strahd von Zarovich. Soon you will be late as well.</p><p>I am going to take my time. After all, you are taking yours.</p><p>Mine was a just war, and we tread on its spoils.</p><p>Terror answers terror.</p><p>Who are you, if not invaders, marauders, and peace-breakers?</p><p>There is none in all of Barovia whose honor you have more cause to trust.</p><p>Murder is not about lust, and it's not about violence. It's about possession.</p><p>There are no monsters; only sons, fathers, and kings. And there will be more dead tomorrow.</p><p>You feel the warmth leave their flesh. You are looking into their eyes. In that moment, you are a god.</p><p>Learn to kill and mind the details. It is not unlike mending greaves. The first time, you are careful. By the thirteenth time, you forget where you left the awl.</p><p>What is one less soul writhing in the muck?</p><p>Do you feel remorse? I never quite grasped its utility.</p><p>Careful, now. If killing has not satisfied you yet, it never will.</p><p>Was today's violence unsatisfying? Perhaps tomorrow will do better.</p><p>Even devils have emotions. Then again, perhaps not.</p><p>We all have the power in our hands to kill, but most are too afraid to use it. The fearless ones control life itself.</p><p>If you endeavor to do something, do it well.</p><p>Clerics are little more than signposts, pointing out a way for others that they never go themselves.</p><p>Despite my ghoulish reputation, I really have the heart of a small boy. I keep it in a jar on my desk.</p><p>Hell is empty and all the devils are here.</p><p>They wish to be reassured about the noises in the cellar, and the window that should not have been open.</p><p>There are horrors beyond life’s edge that we do not suspect, and once in a while your evil prying may call them into range.</p><p>Blood warms the heart. It’s like mulled wine, but with more screaming.</p><p>Horror is only the removal of masks.</p><p>The goal of all life is death.</p><p>There is no shame in weeping. Only do not give up; it spoils the fun.</p><p>I am pleased with your progress.</p><p>Strange how nothingness seems to go on forever.</p><p>We dread the young, because to them we are ghosts.</p><p>I would be lying if I said that nothing is watching you. I would also be telling the truth.</p><p>Most men are not wicked; they are sleepwalkers. Only the wakeful can be truly malicious.</p><p>I wonder which one of you is missing your soul.</p><p>Is gold truly all your life is worth?</p><p>The people had managed to gather a gaggle of brats to present bouquets of flowers to me. During the wars I'd been forced to do many terrible things in the name of duty, but one must draw the line somewhere.</p><p>It was over very quickly, raising a collective gasp from the crowd since it is something of a shock to see how far the blood spurts when a head is expertly severed.</p><p></p><p>The burgomaster, if one could judge anything from his last mortal expression, never knew what hit him.</p><p>I expect my subjects to be honest in their dealings with each other, but most especially with me.</p><p>No soldier ever wearies of receiving letters from home. The smallest detail was always of great interest to me and kept my memories from fading.</p><p>I was not even able to attend the burial of my parents. Their deaths had occurred during the height of a particularly close and bitter campaign, and I could not be spared.</p><p>I looked at my brother and saw myself in him, myself as I should have been.</p><p>It is not that I begrudged Sergei his own life, but that mine had been all but spent, sacrfiiced to duty and obligation.</p><p>Alek Gwilym asked me if I remembered being so eager for blood. I still am, Commander. Can you not tell?</p><p>When the birds grow silent, there's usually a good reason for it.</p><p>The particular dilemma of when and if one should use force always seemed to plague the soldier-priests. Such moral puzzles held no appeal for me whatsoever.</p><p>Sergei's sort of compassion was well placed for a priest, but a ruler cannot afford to be so indulgent.</p><p>Like as not the peasants will use the time away from their fields to clean out their stocks of tuika and spend the following day struggling to recover from the debauch.</p><p>A rich man thinks all others are rich, and an intelligent man thinks all others are similarly gifted. Both are terribly shocked when they discover the truth of the world.</p><p>I don't want the people believing they can just drop their tools and make merry whenever it pleases them, or we'll have no end of holidays to endure.</p><p>In those years of peace, the truth had grown upon my soul like some parasitic plant run wild.</p><p>She was, without doubt, the most beautiful girl I had ever seen.</p><p>As she approached, I came to see that she was as beyond beauty as a river in spring flood is beyond a drop of water.</p><p>She wore the homespun costume of Barovia, but she wore it like royalty, and her copper hair shone like a crown.</p><p>The clear skin, the great eyes—brighter than gems—and full dark lips had come together in such a way as to make all other women seem ugly by comparison.</p><p>I felt my heart swoop and soar at the sheer joy of looking at her.</p><p>I took one of her hands, and she straightened—how like a tall flower she was—and with a bow, lightly kissed her fingertips.</p><p>Be welcome and look upon this as your true home, forevermore.</p><p>Her returning smile was like that first glimpse of sun after a bitter winter. All I wanted to do for the rest of my life was keep that smile on her ever after.</p><p>It was as if the sun that had favored me had been all along hidden by a cloud. Its brilliant glory now shone in full upon him... and him alone.</p><p>She was sky and earth, air and music, sunlight without shadow.</p><p>Along with the sharp joy of love, I was being cut in twain by the razor edge of despair, and I was unable to conceal the pain.</p><p>I could have cried aloud from the agony she so innocently gave me.</p><p>Previously, my interest in the Art had been that of an experimenting dilettante; now it occurred to me that some magical spell might afford the means to my heart's desire.</p><p>Human desires being what they are, one would think the ritual for casting a love-spell or creating a love-philter would be more common, but my books were bereft of such things.</p><p>The writer's conclusion that love was a force that could not be successfully reproduced by magical methods struck me as being inanely smug. I tore the page out and summarily tossed it in the fire.</p><p>As surrender had been, so was black despair once an alient concept to me. Now I was as familiar with both as with my own features, for there they were in my mirror, gazing back at me every day.</p><p>According to popular legend, an eager student once attempted to summon some form of invisible servant. When it came, thing was invisible all right—and rather hungry.</p><p>Blackness surged up and clouded my brain for a time. This had happened before and was becoming more frequent.</p><p>Secret and safe in soe hidden cache within me, the blackness was always ready to rush forth and resume gnawing at my soul like a starved monster.</p><p>Whaever spoke to me was using their voices, hoping to frighten me by their very familiarity.</p><p>The laughter grew, filling the rooms, filling my head, I clapped my hands over my ears, dropping the dagger. Whatever was with me would not be vulnerable to such an insignificant weapon.</p><p>I was dealing with something far beyond my experience in magic and needed no sage to tell me it was deadly.</p><p>Such evil would not have come without some type of summoning on my part, which meant I had a portion of control over it.</p><p>The voices merged and separated around, above, through me. They took on weight with no substance and pressed upon me. The voices laughed at my pain, and in that sound they seemed to assume a single, huge shape.</p><p>My heart pounded... labored. My blood seemed too chill and thick to push through my veins.</p><p>It writhed and twisted and pulsed without rhythm—pleasure from pain, pain from pleasure—and it murmured of things still darker than itself.</p><p>She was sprintime and summer rain, autumn color and winter stillness. And soon, she would be mine.</p><p>He still lived, but was too far lost for awareness. He could not have felt it as I dragged the edge firmly across his throat.</p><p>Blood. A fountain of it. Life. If I dared to take it. As my own life ebbed, I dared not refuse. I drank. Deeply.</p><p>With his heart stilled, the flow had slacked off, but there was yet much to be had. I put my lips to the wound and drank.</p><p>His blood was the sweet savory one keeps to brighten up the end of a dull meal.</p><p>There was perverse warmth to be found in his cooling life.</p><p>I felt strength such as I had never known before, tearing through my veins like heat lightning.</p><p>My last sight of myself was of a man utterly consumed by surprise, utterly ludicrous, utterly laughable with his popping eyes and hanging mouth. My relfection... was gone.</p><p>I sensed something else stirring all around me, like a wind that one feels only in the mind... Magic. Necromancy. I'd done more this night than kill my brother and drink his blood.</p><p>If I'd had to kill a dozen brothers, drink a river of their blood to have her, I would have done so.</p><p>The mist has risen high; the stars are gone.</p><p>I felt the blood rushing through her like the rolling thunder of a summer storm.</p><p>A thousand nights, a thousand years lay before me. Without her.</p><p>I could not die, but they would. Before another hour passed, I would send them wailing on their way to rotting hell. All of them.</p><p>A man does not turn away from stale bread when he is starving to death.</p><p>He screamed, but I heard nothing, deafened as I was by the roar of his rushing blood.</p><p>I, Strahd, am the Land.</p><p>They fought and screamed and died. Their blades passed through me as though I were a wraith with no substance or nerve.</p><p>You shall find no sanctuary here, for I know every stone, every dark corner; this is my home. My home, and your graveyard.</p><p>I could have drained each to the dregs and still hungered.</p><p>By trial and error, I learned just how much to take to feed myself, yet not kill. There was no mercy in my self-discipline, only hunger—for over-indulgence would have quickly deprived me of a stocked larder.</p><p>Death is not beyond me, if I chose to reach for it.</p><p>Stars glow hot above, cool darkness reigns below, and I soar carelessly between, master of the air.</p><p>As age had been eliminated for me, only death remained, measured out in palatable doses that lasted from sunrise to sunset.</p><p>I have resigned myself to the soothing forgetfulness of death, having little other choice. It is better than sleep.</p><p>Some have intended to plague me with hammer, stake, and holy symbols under the mistaken impression they were doing me a favor.</p><p></p><p>My initial year of occupation—along with its judicious and much-talked-about executions—had inspired a new spirit of honesty in the land.</p><p>The wolves of Mount Ghakis are ferocious, but I have yet to hear of one who could break through a handspan of oak.</p><p>Tonight I will dance with the stars; tomorrow I will race along the forest carpet with my brothers, the wolves, or flow like smoke into secret places never touched by a man.</p><p>Any other time, they would have put me to the sword—the standard fate of a thief in this land—but as final arbiter of my own laws, I could make changes as I saw fit.</p><p>Such scum are beyond any honorable death from a blade.</p><p>I raised the nearest struggling man up and, with the greatest of pleasure, tore into his throat. And fed.</p><p>His blood races through me like wind and fire, like the hot rage of battle, with its delirious blending of terror and joy.</p><p>The armies I had commanded are gone now, but I will always uphold the legacy we brought to this land.</p><p>I am lord and law here, and I will not suffer any incursions against me, whatever their form.</p><p>Thieves beware. I, Strahd, walk the land.</p><p>I held him easily and resumed my meal, this time with his fear adding a piquant flavor to the blood.</p><p>The peace of the indifferent dead is held most in the mind of the living.</p><p>Much has happened since then, but little has changed. The people still farm or tend flocks. They fear me, but are obedient. Life for most is hard, but at least they know things are far more difficult elsewhere.</p><p>Those who break my laws rarely get the chance to repeat the offense.</p><p>The Balinoks were overrun with savage druids worshipping pagan gods. One by one, I searched out and... civilized... their sacred fanes until even they were forced to acknowledge my lordship.</p><p>Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.</p><p>There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.</p><p>With how many things are we on the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.</p><p>I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.</p><p>The fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.</p><p>Of what materials was I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture? But I was doomed to live.</p><p>Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents.</p><p>How many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!</p><p>For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.</p><p>She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.</p><p>The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.</p><p>I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death - a state which I feared yet did not understand.</p><p>If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.</p><p>I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.</p><p>You hate me; but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.</p><p>Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you.</p><p>You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.</p><p>You accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, strike me down.</p><p>But hers was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides, but cannot tarnish its brightness.</p><p>I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived, and long for the moment when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.</p><p>There are darknesses in life and there are lights, and she is one of the lights, the light of all lights.</p><p>Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!</p><p>Once again... welcome to Barovia. Come freely. Die quickly; and leave something of the happiness you bring.</p><p>There is a reason why all things are as they are.</p><p>I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.</p><p>Remember my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.</p><p>I want you to believe... to believe in things that you cannot.</p><p>Despair has its own calms.</p><p>Loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings.</p><p>The dead travel fast.</p><p>No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart.</p><p>Though sympathy alone can't alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.</p><p>Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot?</p><p>Ah, it is the fault of our knowledge that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.</p><p>No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.</p><p>Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with a soul like yours.</p><p>Do you believe in destiny? That even the powers of time can be altered for a single purpose? That the luckiest man who walks on this earth is the one who finds… true love?</p><p>The blood is the life!</p><p>No man knows till he experiences it, what it is like to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the woman he loves.</p><p>Euthanasia is an excellent and comforting word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.</p><p>I have been so long master that I would be master still, or at least that none other should be master of me.</p><p>There are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.</p><p>There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part.</p><p>It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.</p><p>I want to cut off his head and take out his heart.</p><p>She is one of the gods' women fashioned by their own hands to show us mortals that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here with us.</p><p>It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.</p><p>Truly there is no such thing as finality.</p><p>And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs!</p><p>You shall know now, as others have learned in full, what it is to cross my path.</p><p>Whilst they played wits against me — against me who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were born — I was countermining them.</p><p>And you are now to me flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for awhile; and shall later on be my companion and my helper.</p><p>You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my call.</p><p>Love is, after all, a selfish thing; and it throws a black shadow on anything between which and the light it stands.</p><p>Souls and memories can do strange things during trance.</p><p>Sleep has no place it can call its own.</p><p>My toil must be in silence, and my efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men will be my greatest strength.</p><p>My revenge is just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side.</p><p>To die, to be really dead, that must be glorious!</p><p>He means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow.</p><p>I have gained more knowledge out of the folly of you madmen than from the writings of the most wise.</p><p>You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears amd alarms.</p><p>And, to my bitter grief, with a shock and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman.</p><p>There will be pain for us all, but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last.</p><p>Faith is that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"56VBJglvFn4iCTMK","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.VdWQSN3uDiWrNogh.JournalEntryPage.56VBJglvFn4iCTMK"}}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677352298121,"modifiedTime":1677352298121,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"7BR85GbIQ4vXzo04","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

It is a vivid exploration of classic gothic horror tropes and monsters, from werewolves to vampires, ghosts, and more. It is a true sandbox, providing players with the freedom to make their own choices and build the kind of adventure they enjoy. It is an unabashedly character-driven campaign, giving your player character an incredible chance to shine and make their mark on the story your group tells.</p>\n<p>However, Curse of Strahd is also a brutal, stressful, and alienating experience. Your character will be trapped in a bleak, gothic land quite different from the world they know. The adventure contains several encounters and areas that will likely be far beyond your capabilities when you first encounter them. It does not provide routine or readily-available loot or magical items.</p>\n<p>For a player who’s not expecting it, Curse of Strahd can suck. Really suck. Let me put it this way: if you want the freedom to engage in combat and exploration without worrying about the potential risks, this is very possibly not the campaign for you. Likewise, if you are potentially triggered by gruesome depictions of horror or psychologically disturbing relationships, or if you prefer a D&amp;D campaign that features only victories or setbacks (rather than the potential for outright defeat), you might want to try a different module.</p>\n<h2>Why Play?</h2>\n<p>Now, if you’re still around, stick with me - because there are reasons to play this (excellent, engaging, incredibly memorable) campaign.</p>\n<p>You should play Curse of Strahd if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>love gothic horror tropes and themes</li>\n<li>want to engage with a character-driven story that pushes you to develop relationships with multiple vivid NPCs and factions</li>\n<li>prefer roleplay, investigation, and relationship-building to combat or dungeon-delving</li>\n<li>enjoy setting your own goals and pursuing means of achieving them</li>\n<li>enjoy facing an active, powerful, and personally antagonizing villain</li>\n<li>want to participate in a tense, adrenaline-fueled experience that will create memories to last a lifetime</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n<p>If, after reading this far, you think Curse of Strahd may be the campaign for you, awesome! You’re in for a fantastic time. With that said, here are a few protips to succeeding in the course of this campaign:</p>\n<p>Intrepid adventurers and sadistic murderhobos don’t last long in Barovia. Don’t tread from the beaten path unless you have good reason to, and don’t alienate or antagonize NPCs if you can avoid it. Make more friends than enemies. Don’t go searching for treasure, fortune, or fame - because you will probably die a horrible death.</p>\n<p>Remember that you are not your character, and invest real time in developing their thoughts, personality, and motivation. Externalize failure, and use setbacks or defeat as an opportunity to explore your character’s perspective and personal growth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Play smart. Many of the enemies in this adventure cannot be overcome easily in direct combat. Use guile, preparation, subterfuge, diplomacy, and research to achieve your goals.</li>\n<li>Spend time engaging with the other characters, even when not discussing plans, tactics, or objectives. Learn about their fears, their perspectives, and their experiences. Build meaningful relationships, not apathetic battle teams.</li>\n<li>Outside goals are hard (if not impossible) to achieve in Barovia. It's worth working with your DM to create a character driven to Barovia for some purpose that can only be fulfilled within its borders. Make sure to speak with your DM about how to shape your backstory into something that can be relevant in the world of Barovia.</li>\n<li>Try to remove yourself from the “XP and loot” model of progression in traditional campaigns and video games, and instead try to enjoy the narrative progression of winning allies, fulfilling objectives, and advancing the story of the campaign and player characters.</li>\n<li><em>Don't try to play an apathetic or evil player character unless you are 100% sure that you can pull it off while being a supportive team player and engaging the story like a normal PC.</em> Seriously. You'll make this adventure a lot more difficult and unenjoyable for your DM, and you'll be cheating yourself out of a fun experience. You don't need to play a knight in shining armor, but you definitely shouldn't play a villain.</li>\n<li>Curse of Strahd, as-written, is full of disturbing and graphic content. If you are potentially triggered by elements of child abuse, murder, stalking, gaslighting, racism, torture, mind control, cannibalism, situations paralleling sexual assault, child death, references to stillbirth/miscarriage, abuse of those with disabilities or mental illness, animal cruelty, body horror, child abandonment, portrayals of alcoholism or drug abuse, potential incest, implied necrophilia, or suicide, speak with your DM about potentially working around or entirely avoiding these elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh - and don’t Google anything related to the campaign. The Web, after all, is dark, and full of spoilers.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"pjgkj2IGlM4vK3MW","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672685769946,"modifiedTime":1672685769946,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"9LirFcN1Lyv5pNHq","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

Lightless grey flames burn in countless sconces carved from skulls mounted upon the walls, which themselves are built from interlocking femurs and decorated with rib cages organized in sickening patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[picture a macabre catacombs like under Paris or similar medieval constructions] </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the center of the chamber, behind a throne forged of skulls, ribs, clavicles, and femurs, towers a serpentine wyrm with a body formed of jagged grey spikes, its head terminating in a massive, tooth-filled maw that extends beyond the edges of its body, without eyes or other facial features. Twin skeletal wings extend from its back, its vast wingspan brushing the edges of the chamber.</p>\n<p>The figure regards Dragomir, coils itself up to a height, and you feel its gaze upon you. It speaks, but not from it's body; the sounds seem to emanate from inside the creature, and take shape in your head.</p>\n<p>\"I am pleased by your dedication. You are using my boons well, and by furthering my gifts to you, I expect a reciprocal amount of servitude. You are almost powerful enough to confront Vampyr's champion.</p>\n<p>\"Reap the remaining souls from this barren plane and offer them to Me. With some additional power gleaned from these offerings, I will then wrest control of this plane! I will open its borders to foolish outsiders! I will enjoy forevermore a feast of these future souls!</p>\n<p>\"You - you will become the immortal Lord of the mortals, and you will be my Voice, act ingin my stead for those unblessed to hear my command.\" </p>\n<p>The creature pauses, and a malevolent gaze seems to pierce your very being.  Its eyes are invisible, but there is a sense of a narrowed, considered gaze.</p>\n<p>\"I sense a small resistance buried within you, Servant. Hesitation is weakness! Your only future, aside from repearting your curse of briefly living portions of a life and then perishing to relive another small portion, never gaining any satisfaction of completion, lies with Me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Should you deny my Gifts, I will take that as a defiance. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Defiance is unforgivable and futile!</span>\"</p>\n<p>It seems to smile, an expression of utter bleakness. </p>\n<p>\"If you actually choose defiance, know this: your brother will pay the price of your transgression. I shall consume the remainder of his body by my Fire. I will gorge myself on the last shreds of his humanity , and his sanity will shatter into utter incurable madness.  This is one path you may cause.\"</p>\n<p>\"The other path contains no such unpleasantness. Follow me, and Izek shall raise up with you as a trusted companion and enforcer. He shall  be your 'right hand man,' (the being chuckles at the horrible pun) \"and these lands will ever further be orderly under your dual enforcement of my whims.\"</p>\n<p>It smirks.</p>\n<p>\"To me, your Choice is obvious.  You have but one path - my Servant. Heed my counsel. Obey my instructions. Surrender to your fate and assume your rightful place as my ruler over the pathetic mortals in this plane. Your pathetic Ilmater cares for suffering - know that only as my Servant can you end suffering as you envision. As ruler, you shall not toy with them like Vampyr's puppet.\"</p>\n<p>As the ruler, you will be mercifully quick in your judgement, and your subjects will not suffer eternal limbo between shells of lives. Their lives may be brief, but they will shine have meaningful beginnings and ends.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am eager to witness your human ingenuity in how you choose to fulfill your fate.\"</p>\n<p>The figure pauses and simply observes Dragonir, seemingly peering into his very inner being. </p>\n<p>Dragomir bows deeply to Tarakamedes before holding Its eyeless gaze.</p>\n<p>\"I will serve and worship dutifully as one within your service, but I have a request. Let the people and citizens of Barovia be mine to control, in both body and soul. Let none be offered to you without my leave, and in me you will find a servant like no other. Through me you will have a spirit-feast beyond even your deep and magnificent comprehension.\"</p>\n<p>The impending silence feels opressive, even heavy. Time seems to freeze in the stillness. Finally, the sensation shatters with the figure nodding slightly. </p>\n<p>\"Very well. Secure your place as Ruler of these lands, and in turn I will grant you agency as to which souls are offered and which are not.\"</p>\n<p>\"Heed my counsel - your companions are weaker than you, more ignorant and close minded. However, they will prove useful in your efforts. Use their assistance to rid the land of Vampyr's champion, assume the rulerships, and retain companionable relations so that they view you as a continued ally. After all, it would be foolish to foster resistance before one has even assumed the throne, no?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This vision fades from view, and Dragomir returns to conciousness feeling chilled, as if he rested in a particularly cold spot.

Unlike many of the other mages I had met with, I had not studied under a master or at a college, I was entirely self-taught. I could not extrapolate spells and arcane concepts from years of learned experience, and many of the tomes I had located were poorly written or the work of amateurs. But amongst the Silver Dragon Argynvost’s notes were details of a dark temple, a place of great power up in the mountain. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd paces his study frustrated. All around him are magical books strewn about, his notes cluttering every open space, but he still seems upset. He picks up a handwritten journal that appears to be damaged by fire. He casts a spell over it and the book repairs itself slightly, he studies it intently. There is a knock at the door, and Rahadin enters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As I called on Rahadin to tell me what he know of this secret place, Rahadin finally admitted that this was why had encouraged me to come of the valley to begin with. He said that he had wanted to wait until we had complete control of the valley before mentioning the temple. Millenia ago, before the kingdom of the Dusk Elves had risen to power, a cabal of wizards had chosen this remote valley to build a stronghold, a temple of forgotten knowledge. They had hidden many dangerous and powerful things in temple, not wishing for their enemies or rivals to get their hands on them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd, Rahadin, and a small number of soldiers begin travelling south. As they venture further south, the colder it seems to become. They pass by a village of Mountain Folk, comprised of goliaths and humans alike. As the snow settles on the ground, the soldiers begin to shiver and worry, but Strahd presses on unworried. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The road curved and climbed, making a lengthy switchback into this edge of mount Ghakis. The air grew colder, not warmer, and patches of snow became more frequent until they were unbroken. We fought more revenants, the Order seeming to try their best to keep us away from this path. Thought we lost several of our number, we dispatched them without too much effort and continued onward. It was not long before I beheld a beautiful and terrible sight. An ancient temple hidden away in the side of the mountain, simply waiting for me to arrive to discover its secrets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the distance is a structure carved into the mountain itself, hidden from all other side by the natural cliffside. There are pillars and alcoves, each filled with a large carved statue, though of what you are not certain, the wind is blowing too much snow in the air.  Strahd steps forward with a smirk on his face.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My men would not enter the place, afraid of the power they felt emanating from this place, and Rahadin accompanied me from a distance, having no arcane knowledge himself and not wishing to disturb my exploration of these abandoned halls. I quickly found the library, but was quickly frustrated as the wizards had cleverly bespelled the books. Although I did eventually find some of what I sought from those tomes, it was what was within the lower halls that changed my life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd opens a book excitedly before scowling and trying a few more before sighing and putting them all back. He seems ready to storm out of the temple when he seems to hear something and makes his way down the stairs. Everything seems to go hazy and dark here, and you catch only glimpses of Strahd as he seems to be moving through shifting blackness, the world around him not visible to you for some strange and unsettling reason. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I found within the lower halls was without compare; I was awestruck and frightened, and after we left, when I tried to recall the specifics, they seemed to blur together and run from my memory. I remember one in particular, it writhed and twisted and pulsed without rhythm—pleasure from pain, pain from pleasure—and it murmured of things still darker than itself. The voices merged and separated around, above, through me. They took on weight with no substance and pressed upon me. The voices laughed at my pain, and in that sound they seemed to assume a single, huge shape.</p>\n<p>They looked at me and they offered my greatest desire, whispered to me how I might achieve it. They made promises and expectations, but I was not fool enough to take them at their word. And so we left that place, though I would return several more times, always drawn to the lower level. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd back in Ravenloft, looking at his arcane tomes that no longer hold any more surprises or answers for him. You watch him spend long nights and days trying to govern and deal with everything, always returning to his wizard studies afterward. However, he doesn’t seem to make any new progress. One day he runs his hand through his hair exhaustedly. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I began to feel my age. I had seen it before in the silver at my temples and the lines on my face, but now I truly began to feel it: in the ache of my bones after a day of travel, in the scattering of my thoughts at the slightest distraction, in the sharp pain of the long scar on my left side from the elf assassin's spear.</p>\n<p>I had begun my long battle with an enemy who none had ever escaped, Death itself. I contemplated what I had been offered, a solution that would spare me not only from Death’s clutches but also from ravages of time itself. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd walks to a standing mirror and examines his face which has a few wrinkles in it now. The scene fades away once more and you hear Strahd’s voice one final time as you return to reality. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was a man of war, and before me stood my final foe. I resolved to make an end of him as I had done all the enemies that came before.</p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"u2ZRp8O72UFRGB7P","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672519521300,"modifiedTime":1672519521300,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"CP0eO3OtQ84gwHjI","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

No sound cuts the silence except for mournful sobbing that echoes through the streets from a distance.</p></aside><p>The sobbing comes from Mad Mary’s townhouse (area E3).

Bildrath’s Mercantile</h3><blockquote><p>The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn heavy curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads “Bildrath’s Mercantile.”</p></blockquote><p>The establishment is 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. The owner, Bildrath Cantemir (LN male human @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.7xiZS3jBz4J3xlb8]{commoner}), sells items from the Adventuring Gear table in the Player’s Handbook, but only items with a price lower than 25 gp in the table, and he sells them for ten times the price.</p><p>Bildrath trades with the Vistani when they pass through. He is also happy to make a profit from any strangers unlucky enough to find themselves here. He serves his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains since, as he says, “If you want it badly enough, you’ll pay for it.” He has no competition in the village.</p><p>If the characters give Bildrath a hard time, he calls Parriwimple (LG male human), his nephew and stock-boy, to help him out. Parriwimple has the statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.px74h7wp4Md5l7FS]{gladiator}, except that he has an Intelligence of 6 and doesn’t carry a shield (AC 14). Parriwimple’s real name is Parpol Cantemir, but no one in the village calls him that. His muscles rippling beneath his leather tunic should give ample notice of his strength. At the same time, Parriwimple is simple-minded. He is devoted to his uncle and will not follow the characters as long as Bildrath has something to say about it.</p><h3>E2. Blood of the Vine Tavern</h3><blockquote><p>A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.</p></blockquote><p>The tavern building is about 60 feet square. Close inspection of the sign reveals that it originally read “Blood of the Vine.” (An “n” has been scratched over with the “f.”) This once finely appointed tavern has grown shoddy over the years. A blazing fire in the hearth gives scant warmth to the few huddled souls within. They include the barkeep, three Vistani sitting together, and a man named @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.wGMhHh7d4vuux4KC]{Ismark Kol­yanovich}—who happens to be the son of the village burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich.</p><h3>Roleplaying Ismark</h3><p>Ismark (LG male human @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.j89ufp0qduogoM8r]{veteran}) is a young man who sits by himself at a corner table, sipping his wine. Other villagers call him “Ismark the Lesser” because he has lived in the shadow of his father for most of his life.</p><p>Ismark isn’t a typically dour Barovian. He invites the characters to join him, offers to pay for their wine, and asks for their aid in protecting his adopted sister, @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.zP2uAqXHHG9yZ4lz]{Ireena Kolyana}. If they agree to help, he takes them to the burgomaster’s residence (area @UUID[.ND0PIQzPOmZqiarG#e4.-burgomasters-mansion]{E4}). He wants the characters to help him escort Ireena to Vallaki, a settlement in the heart of the valley, beyond the view of Castle Ravenloft and (he hopes) beyond the reach of Strahd. Ismark knows that moving Ireena is a gamble, since she’s vulnerable to Strahd when she is outside their home, but he has heard assertions that Vallaki is well-defended.</p><p>Ismark is as tight-lipped as any of the other Barovian villagers, unless the talk deals with Ireena or Strahd. Ismark knows everything the other villagers know. He also knows that, for some unknown reason, Strahd is attracted to Ireena and desires her above all others.</p><p>If you used the “Plea for Help” adventure hook and the characters show Ismark the letter they received, he knows the burgomaster’s handwriting well enough to confirm that the letter was not written by his father.</p><p>Ismark has spent most of his adult life training with weapons in the hope of one day confronting and killing the Strahd. If the characters suggest that he accompany them, Ismark agrees provided that Ireena is first taken to a place of safety. As long as Ismark accompanies the characters, he acts as a party member for the purpose of determining each character’s share of experience points (though he gains no experience points himself).</p><h4>Roleplaying the Other NPCs</h4><p>Use the following information to roleplay the other NPCs in the tavern.</p><p><em><strong>Arik the Barkeep.</strong></em> A pudgy little man named Arik Lorensk (CN male human @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.7xiZS3jBz4J3xlb8]{commoner}) tends bar. Mindlessly, he cleans glasses, one after another. When they’re all clean, he starts over. If he is spoken to, he takes orders for drinks in a dull, hollow voice. A small glass of wine costs 1 cp. A pitcher of wine costs 1 sp. After serving drinks, Arik returns to cleaning glasses. He ignores all attempts to question him.</p><p><em><strong>Vistani Owners.</strong></em> Three Vistani @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.AZWQsIIm4EnM27H7]{spies} (N female humans) named Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia sit at a table near the front door. They own the tavern and see to it that all customers pay their tabs. They otherwise show little interest in the characters.</p><p>If the characters arrive in the company of other Vistani, the owners are much more likely to engage them in conversation and provide useful information. They suggest that the characters visit Madam Eva (see chapter 2, area @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.journals.XrZpvPNirJ6ctqxB.JournalEntryPage.cnWVv7FV8UsySkzu#g.-tser-pool-encampment]{G}) to have their fortunes read.</p><h3>E3. Mad Mary’s Townhouse</h3><blockquote><p>A moaning sob floats through the still, gray streets, coloring your thoughts with sadness. The sounds flow from a dark, two-story townhouse.</p></blockquote><img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/720/cos03-04.png\" /><p>The house, which is about 40 feet square, is boarded up and barricaded from the inside. Mad Mary (CN female human @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.7xiZS3jBz4J3xlb8]{commoner}) sits in the center of the floor in an upstairs bedroom, clutching a malformed doll. She is lost in her sorrow and despondency. She barely recognizes the presence of anyone in the room. She says nothing in the presence of anger, but she will talk, albeit haltingly, to someone who talks with her gently.</p><p>Mary hid her beloved daughter, @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.ZNfHuMvCfn1VZEcw]{Gertruda}, in this house for the girl’s entire life. Gertruda, now a teenager, broke out of the house a week ago and has not been seen since. Her mother fears the worst—and is justified in doing so. See area K42 in chapter 4 for more information on Gertruda’s fate.</p><p>The malformed doll has a strange leer and wears a sackcloth dress. It belonged to Mary in her youth and was passed down to Gertruda. Gadof Blinsky, the toymaker of Vallaki (see chapter 5, area N7), made the doll. Stitched into the hem of its dress is a frayed tag bearing the words “Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!”</p><h3>E4. Burgomaster’s Mansion</h3><blockquote><p>A weary-looking mansion squats behind a rusting iron fence. The iron gates are twisted and torn. The right gate lies cast aside, while the left swings lazily in the wind. The stuttering squeal and clang of the gate repeats with mindless precision. Weeds choke the grounds and press with menace upon the house itself. Yet, against the walls, the growth has been tramped down to create a path all about the domain. Heavy claw markings have stripped the once-beautiful finish of the walls. Great black marks tell of the fires that have assailed the mansion. Not a pane nor a shard of glass stands in any window. All the windows are barred with planks, each one marked with stains of evil omen.</p></blockquote><p>Characters who survey the grounds can, with a successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check, discern trampled weeds all around the mansion as well as scores of wolf paw prints and human footprints. The footprints were made by zombies and ghouls under Strahd’s control.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.zP2uAqXHHG9yZ4lz]{Ireena Kolyana} (LG female human noble with 14 hit points), the adopted daughter of the burgomaster, is inside the mansion and won’t open the heavily barred door to anyone unless she is convinced that those outside her door have no allegiance to Strahd. If the characters convince her, either with good roleplaying or a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, or if Ismark is with them, she opens the door and invites them in.</p><p>If the characters enter the mansion, read:</p><blockquote><p>The interior of the mansion is well furnished, yet the fixtures show signs of great wear. Noticeable oddities are the boarded-up windows and the presence of holy symbols in every room. The burgomaster is in a side drawing room on the floor—lying in a simple wooden coffin surrounded by wilting flowers and a faint odor of decay.</p></blockquote><p>Ismark and Ireena made the coffin themselves.</p><h3>Roleplaying Ireena</h3><p>Ireena, a striking young woman with auburn hair, has been bitten twice by Strahd. The villagers are afraid of her and avoid her. The characters are Ireena’s best hope for protection, so she is willing to accompany them under certain conditions. Although she appears mild, she has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself. She doesn’t remember her early past. She doesn’t know how she came to Barovia or where she came from. Moreover, her encounters with Strahd are fuzzy memories, thanks to his vampiric charm, but she can recall clearly the blazing hunger in his eyes.</p><p>She tells the characters that wolves and other terrible creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks. The burgomaster’s heart couldn’t stand the constant assault, and he died three days ago. Strangely, since his death, the house has not come under attack.</p><p>She says that no one from the village has been brave enough to help Ismark take Kolyan Indirovich to the cemetery for proper burial. Ireena asks the characters if they would be so kind as to help Ismark deliver her father’s body safely to Donavich, the local priest (area E5). She refuses to be taken to Vallaki or anywhere else while the burgomaster lies dead on the mansion floor.</p><h3>E5. Church</h3><blockquote><p>Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports Castle Ravenloft, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load.</p></blockquote><p>If the characters approach the church doors, add:</p><blockquote><p>The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.</p></blockquote><p>The village priest, <strong>Donavich</strong>, lives here. Other Barov­ians shun the church for reasons that will quickly become obvious.</p><p>The following areas correspond to labels on the map of the church below.</p><img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/2/673/004.jpg\" /><h4>E5a. Hall</h4><blockquote><p>The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.</p><p>You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Suddenly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.</p></blockquote><p>The scream comes from the church’s undercroft (area E5g). The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to Donavich, the priest (see area E5f).</p><h4>E5b. Doru’s Bedroom</h4><blockquote><p>This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden holy symbol.</p></blockquote><p>This room once belonged to Doru, Donavich’s son, who is trapped in the undercroft (area E5g). It hasn’t been used in more than a year and contains nothing of value.</p><h4>E5c. Donavich’s Bedroom</h4><blockquote><p>This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.</p></blockquote><p>This is Donavich’s room and contains nothing of value.</p><h4>E5d. Trapdoor</h4><blockquote><p>Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock. A young man’s screams of anguish can be heard through the door.</p></blockquote><p>Donavich lost the key to the iron padlock. If the chain is removed and the trapdoor is opened, the screaming in the undercroft stops. The trapdoor is swollen and stuck in its frame, so that a successful DC 12 Strength check is required to pull it open. Below it is a wooden staircase that descends 15 feet into the undercroft (area E5g).</p><blockquote><h4>E5e. Office</h4><p>An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them—a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.</p></blockquote><p>An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank parchment, along with a couple of quill pens and dried-up jars of ink.</p><p>For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little. Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: <em>Hymns to the Dawn</em>, a volume of chants to the Morninglord, and <em>The Blade of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition</em>, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.</p><h4>E5f. Chapel</h4><blockquote><p>The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.</p></blockquote><p>If the characters have not already entered the undercroft, add:</p><blockquote><p>From beneath the chapel floor, you hear a young man’s voice cry out, “Father! I’m starving!”</p></blockquote><img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/723/cos03-07.png\" /><p><strong>Donavich</strong> (LG male human @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.cgXBlJdO2AwvUfNE]{acolyte}) has been praying throughout the night. His voice is hoarse and weak. He is, in a word, insane. A little more than a year ago, his twenty-year-old son <strong>Doru</strong> and several other villagers stormed Castle Ravenloft in revolt, having been lured there by a wizard in black robes who came to Barovia from a faraway land (see chapter 2, area @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.journals.XrZpvPNirJ6ctqxB.JournalEntryPage.iRWYxHpOL1CEL7kV#m.-mad-mage-of-mount-baratok]{M}, for more information on the wizard). By all accounts, the wizard died by Strahd’s hand, and so too did Doru, who returned to his father as a @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.v1xFGVuVvCzSfmsw]{vampire spawn}. Donavich was able to trap his son in the church’s undercroft, where he remains to this day.</p><p>Doru hasn’t fed since he was imprisoned, and he cries out to his father at all hours. Meanwhile, Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how to save Doru without destroying him. If the characters seem intent on slaying Doru, Donavich does his best to stop them. If Doru dies, Donavich falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair.</p><p>In addition to the lore known to all Barovians (see “Barovian Lore” in @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.journals.XrZpvPNirJ6ctqxB.JournalEntryPage.l3XqH3TagsiyI4ny#barovian-lore]{chapter 2}), Donavich knows the following useful information:</p><ul><li><p>Ireena Kolyana isn’t the natural daughter of Kolyan Indirovich. Although Ireena never knew, Kolyan found her at the edge of the Svalich Woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. She was but a girl then and seemed to have no memory of her past. Kolyan adopted her and loved her dearly.</p></li><li><p>Every night at midnight, the spirits of dead adventurers rise up out of the church graveyard, forming a silent procession as they walk the road toward Castle Ravenloft. (See “March of the Dead” in the “Special Events” section at the chapter’s end.)</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Funeral for the Burgomaster.</strong></em> If the characters bring Kolyan Indirovich’s body to the church, Donavich presses the characters into helping him bury the burgomaster in the cemetery (area E6) at dawn. During the burial, Donavich offers prayers to the Morning­lord in exchange for Kolyan Indirovich’s deliverance from Barovia.</p><p>Once Kolyan is put in the ground, Donavich suggests that Ireena be taken as far from Castle Ravenloft as possible. He proposes that the characters take her to the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk (chapter 8) or, failing that, the fortified town of Vallaki (chapter 5). Donavich is unaware that the abbey, once a bastion of good, has become a den of evil.</p><h4>E5g. Undercroft</h4><p>The church’s undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pillars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Candlelight from the chapel above slips though the cracks, allowing you to glimpse a gaunt shape in the far corner.</p><img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/724/cos03-08.png\" /><p>The shape is Doru, a vampire spawn sent by Strahd to torment Donavich and cast down the church. Doru is starved for blood and brave enough to attack a lone character. If the characters approach as a group, he does his best to avoid them while hissing, “I can smell your blood!” If they cut off his escape, he lunges forth and attacks.</p><p>If the characters restrain Doru and either promise him blood or threaten to destroy him, or if they kill him and then raise him from the dead, he recounts the events that led to his downfall (see area E5f).</p><p>Fortunes of Ravenloft</p><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is in the undercroft, it’s contained in a moldy, old chest in the southwest corner of the room. The chest is unlocked and not trapped.</p><p>E6. Cemetery</p><p>A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.</p><p>During daytime, the cemetery is a still and peaceful place.

A small sign introduces it as \"St. Andral's Orphanage\".</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>The Orphanage is home to Milivoj the gravedigger, Headmistress Claudia Belasco, and almost two dozen orphans. The Orphanage’s most recent addition, an eight-year-old boy named Felix, is possessed by a demon and has been hurting the other children. </p>\n<p>Using Felix as a humanoid vessel, the demon has been secretly tormenting the other children, giving them night terrors and feeding off their souls, leaving terrible bruising and wounds behind. It is also responsible for the murder of another orphan named Cedrik, which was ruled as an accident.</p>\n<p>An overtone of fear has shrouded the orphanage since Felix’s arrival. Three boys - Lazlo, Hans, and Franz - recently fled the Orphanage for fear of the Headmistress, and are currently being held captive at the Werewolf Den. Milivoj has fallen gravely ill. The demon shall soon claim Milivoj’s soul and be truly free unless something is done to stop it.</p>\n<h2>Orphanage Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<p><strong>Finding the Bones of St. Andral</strong>. The easiest way to hook your players into the orphanage is to use Milivoj, the gravedigger at the Church of St. Andral. When your players go to question Milivoj about the missing bones, Father Lucian will tell the party that they can find the young man at the orphanage and that he hasn’t shown up to work for several days.</p>\n<p><strong>Old Bonegrinder Orphans</strong>. If the players had an encounter with the hags at Old Bonegrinder, they may leave the windmill with 1-3 new children in tow: Myrtle, Freek, and Lucian.</p>\n<p>Once arriving in Vallaki, the PCs will be looking for a place to safely leave the children they've rescued. The orphanage is an obvious solution for that.</p>\n<h2>Roleplaying the Residents of the Orphanage</h2>\n<p><strong>Headmistress Claudia Belasco</strong>. A shrewd woman in her early fifties, Ms. Belasco loves propriety and order. She wears her grey streaked brown hair up in a tight bun and has developed fine wrinkles around her mouth from years of disapproving frowns.</p>\n<p>The orphans aren't particularly fond of Ms. Belasco as she is the primary source of discipline in the house. They've taken to calling her, Ms. Witch, behind her back and the elder kids tell nasty stories about Ms. Belasco eating naughty children in her meals. Despite her general unlikable nature, Ms. Belasco cares for her children very much. She long ago stopped worrying about being liked in return. As long as the orphans are safe and healthy, Ms. Belasco will give out as many lectures as she sees fit.</p>\n<p>Ms. Belasco knows something is wrong at the orphanage and is doing her best to discover the source of their recent string of bad luck. She rightly believes that Cedrik’s death was no accident and found a mysterious locket on his body which she suspects is evil. She also worries that Felix may not be totally sane, but will only share this information with someone she truly trusts.</p>\n<p>If the players get on her good side, possibly by showing their similar and heartfelt concern for the orphans, she’ll share what little information she’s gathered.</p>\n<p><strong>Felix</strong>. Felix has only lived at the orphanage for the past few months. Prior to his arrival, Felix happened upon a cursed locket and released a demon trapped inside. The demon possessed Felix and made him murder his own parents, sending him to St. Andral’s Orphanage.</p>\n<p>Felix’s demon was sealed within the locket by a cleric who was unable to conquer it. While the demon has great power now that it has a humanoid vessel, it is still not technically free of the locket. Only by devouring an exceptionally strong soul can it finally find release. The illness that is slowly killing Milivoj is actually the draining of his soul. When Milivoj dies, the ritual will be complete and the demon will slaughter the residents of the orphanage.</p>\n<p>Currently, Felix isn’t Felix. He’s the demon. He acts like a young sociopath with a talent for falsehoods. His emotional range is quite shallow and he shows almost no sympathy for the plights of others, smiling if Cedrik’s death is mentioned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I don’t see why everyone was so upset when Cedrik died. I saw his body. He only bled a little bit. My parents bled a lot more than that and I’m fine.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milivoj</strong>. (LG Human Commoner with Strength 15 (+2) for the sake of this adventure). A former orphan and resident at the orphanage, Milivoj now lives at the orphanage as a caretaker and helps care for the children. Milivoj gives whatever meager earnings he gains to help support the house and care for his foster siblings. The children love him and revere him as their elder brother. Milivoj is nineteen years old, jaded, and sullen. But when it comes to the other children, he instantly mellows. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the strength of Milivoj’s compassion for the children of the orphanage also drew the attention of Felix’s demon. Shortly after Felix’s arrival, the demon began nibbling at Milivoj’s soul, making him sick. What began as a slight cough slowly escalated. Milivoj eventually could barely keep up with his work and agreed to steal the Bones of St. Andral to make up for his lost wages. He used the gold he had left from the job to employ the wolf hunters, Szoldar and Yevgeni, to find the runaway boys and desperately hopes the three children are returned to the orphanage safely. Milivoj has since been completely incapacitated by the illness.</p>\n<p>If nothing is done about the demon, Milivoj will die and the secret of the bones’ location will die with him.</p>\n<p><strong>The Other Orphans</strong>. Many of the orphans sport various bruises and mild injuries. These come from Felix’s demon feeding on their life force in the night. None of the children have any idea how they received their injuries.</p>\n<p>All the children have been suffering from horrific night terrors. Most nights are interrupted by more than one terrified scream.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</section>"},"_id":"SgkF9QOgIHQJVrPu","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.QHPQpaAEP12uzr8f.JournalEntryPage.SgkF9QOgIHQJVrPu"}}},{"name":"N11 Vasili von Holtz","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The windows of this large home are all covered by dark curtains.</p>"},"_id":"zblLXMG4bYoJdPXm","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Onh3nejOkTTvCkuR.JournalEntryPage.zblLXMG4bYoJdPXm"}}},{"name":"N12 Vallakovich Reformation Center","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>This stone building frowns over the passersby. Surrounded by a strong iron fence (15 ft tall), the only entrance is a set of double doors.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Executioner’s Court</h2>\n<p>During their wanderings of the streets of Vallaki, the players might attend a session of Executioner’s Court. You might use a court session to further exemplify Vallaki’s totalitarian government. Perhaps the players are attracted by a crowd at the courthouse. Perhaps they follow another NPC. In any case, the following trials might take place.</p>\n<p><strong>Siggurd Rilsky</strong>. Siggurd missed the Wolf’s Head Jamboree because of his mother’s recent passing. She grew ill over the course of a few days and died on the day of the festival. Siggurd is sentenced to five days in the stocks, for which he is incredibly grateful.</p>\n<p><strong>Mrs. Ivana Mironova</strong>. Mrs. Mironova is a cultist and avid follower of Lady Watcher. Her son, a fourteen year old boy, once spent time at the Reformation Center and came back broken. Ivana has since come to hate the Baron and joined the cult to stop him. During her trial, she remains adamantly tight lipped and bitter. The only things she has to say are some vulgar obscenities aimed at Vargas. For her refusal to cooperate and her open hostility, Ivana is sentenced as a tier two criminal and is lead down to the sensory deprivation ward.</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Ulbrek</strong>. Jonathan got into a drunken altercation three nights prior and he ended up in a fight with some guards, giving one a nice, black eye. Though he remembers nothing of the event and is incredibly remorseful, Jonathan is sentenced as a first tier prisoner.</p>\n<h2>Breaking In to the Center</h2>\n<p>Throughout their stay in Vallaki, players might have multiple reasons to try and infiltrate the Reformation Center. Perhaps another player has been imprisoned. Perhaps they’ve been recruited into an underground revolution. Perhaps the goodness in their hearts simply demands they investigate and liberate. Here are some hooks and sources of information that may entice them.</p>\n<p><strong>The Martikovs</strong>. The Keepers of the Feather primarily work against Strahd. However, they aren’t particularly fond of other sources of evil either. Urwin and Danika Martikov, the wereraven proprietors at the Blue Water Inn, have had their eye on the Reformation Center for quite a while. If players show interest in the center or otherwise ally with the Martikovs, they may suggest the players do something about the Reformation Center.</p>\n<p><strong>Guards at the Blue Water Inn</strong>. Every so often, guards from the center spend their time off duty drinking wine at the Inn. If coaxed, the guards, Laslo and Burns, will provide information once drunk enough.</p>\n<p>These two know the general layout of the 1st and 2nd floors of the prison. They also find it annoying keeping track of all the different keys for the many locked doors in the prison and wish they had a skeleton key like the Burgomaster’s. </p>\n<p><strong>Cook</strong>. Cook has his own cart, pulled by a single mule, which he uses to get food and supplies for the Center. Cook isn’t terribly observant and one or two players can easily sneak into his cart when his back is turned.</p>\n<p><strong>The Escapee</strong>. Andre Duveskov is the man who tunneled his way to freedom from the underground prison. Andre has been living in secret at the Church of St. Andral, under the care of Father Lucian.</p>\n<p>Andre’s wife was once coveted by another man before their marriage. When she chose Andre over him, the rejected man falsely accused her of Strahd worship in retribution. Andre’s wife was sentenced to the Reformation Center and returned home months later mentally broken. She took her own life weeks later.</p>\n<p>Wrought with grief and anger, Andre lashed out at the Burgomaster during one of the festivals and was taken to the Center as well. However, his anger far outlasted the many steps of torture the Reformers dished out. Eventually, he was sent to the underground cells to be forgotten.</p>\n<p>Andre is the only one who’s seen and experienced the full extent of the Reformation Center’s tortures and lived to tell the tale. He’s a broken man with nothing but anger left in his heart. He speaks in circles, often mixing the past and the present and often rockets between extreme anger and extreme grief. </p>\n<p>However, players who can successfully navigate his madness can gain a myriad of useful information on the Center, including the relative location of his tunnel.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Out of the Center</h2>\n<p>On the opposite end, if a player ends up a prisoner in the center, you don’t want them to sit idly by waiting to be rescued. Here are some hooks an imprisoned player might use to break out of the center.</p>\n<p><strong>The Kind Guard</strong>. Livius Groza is a middle aged man who’s been a guard for most of his life. He’s not terribly enamored with life in Vallaki, but he’s also smart enough not to actively oppose the governing law. </p>\n<p>Livius is one of the main guards on alternating duty on the second floor. If a prisoner looks particularly down or beaten, he whispers them careful words of encouragement. Charismatic players can convince Livius to turn a blind eye to their actions or smuggle them small things. In an escape attempt, Livius is the kind of man who will point his fellow guards in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Prisoners</strong>. The cells on the second level aren’t walled off. The barred doors allow prisoners to both see and speak to those in neighboring cells. Though this is discouraged by the patrolling guards, the more level headed prisoners converse anyway. </p>\n<p>Players might learn various intel on the prison and Vallaki in general. Particularly creative players might be able to work together with other prisoners to arrange a group escape.</p>\n<p><strong>The Key in the Corner</strong>. Down in sensory deprivation cells, a former inmate managed to swipe a skeleton key off a Reformer a few years prior. The former inmate unfortunately didn’t survive their treatment and the Reformer has since replaced the key with a copy. The original was never found. </p>\n<p>If a player is locked in one of the dark, soundless cells, they can find the key tucked into the grout between stones with a DC 20 Investigation check. The key won’t work on their cell door (as it’s locked with a bolt and latch from the outside instead of a standard keyhole), but if players hold onto it when they’re moved back to the upper levels of the prison, they have a useful tool.</p>\n<p><strong>The Tunnel</strong>. Other prisoners tell the story of an old prisoner named Andre, who went mad under the torture. Andre actually believed that if he were moved to the lower, less guarded but more isolated levels of the prison, he may be able to tunnel his way to freedom. </p>\n<p>Andre did get what he wanted: he was eventually moved to the lower cells. The other prisoners who tell Andre’s story all believe him a fool who’s still trapped down there. </p>\n<h2>Vive la Revolution</h2>\n<p>As mentioned in the Adventure Hooks at the beginning of this module, it is entirely possible that the Festival of the Blazing Sun will lead to city wide revolts against the Burgomaster, lead by Fiona Wachter.</p>\n<p>Should this occur, once the mobs are let loose from the square, the angry people of Vallaki will rush the Burgomaster’s Mansion and the Reformation Center. The players have the option of joining them in their storming of the Center, either as allies or openly leading the mobs alongside Lady Watcher. </p>\n<p>Should players join in a city wide attack against the Reformation Center, they will be accompanied by six angry mobs as well as one fourth of the guards currently employed at the center.</p>\n<p>The players can influence whether or not the Reformers and other guards are either captured or killed as well as whether or not the building still stands after the dust settles. </p>\n<p> </p>\n</section>"},"_id":"EMfFqWdeaDTri4IM","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ZnT4oSSpb4ng8W3u.JournalEntryPage.EMfFqWdeaDTri4IM"}}}],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"e184110c5455e7e1f3558e0970d2293bd15bcd24","sourceId":"JournalEntry.H1XQ63mYdJMi2VJh"},"cf":{"id":"temp_yr0crbxvuec","path":"Curse of Strahd","color":"#98020a"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672545463435,"modifiedTime":1677352298391,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"H1XQ63mYdJMi2VJh","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

Because the character's early memories are dubious, it's possible that they are originally from Barovia and have family or connections there. They may reunite with a long lost family member during the campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>Silver Blooded</strong>. The player character is a distant descendant of Argynvost. When the player meets his ghost in Argynvostholt, the dragon recognizes the player character as their kin immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>A Deal Struck</strong>. This deal may have been with one of the evil Dark Powers that shroud the Domains of Dread. At one point, the Dark Power may ask the player character to commit a horrible and immoral deed, like killing Father Lucian in Vallaki. If the player refuses, consider giving them some form of madness from the DMG.</p>\n<p><strong>Prophetic Nightmares</strong>. The player character may have Vistani roots or heritage. You might send this player ambiguous dreams of events to come in the campaign. These dreams all assume those events all end in the worst way. </p>\n<p><strong>Guardian</strong>. This player character holds a sliver of a vestige from the Amber Temple, which was chipped away from a larger sarcophagus. On finding the sarcophagus, the vestige possesses the player character and tries to force them to free the vestige by breaking the sarcophagus.</p>\n<p><strong>A Holy Calling</strong>. Pelor bids this player character to kill the Abbott in the Abbey of St. Markovia. If the Abbott finds out about this calling, he tries to convince the player character that this message is from a false and evil god, like the Dark Powers.</p>\n<p><strong>A Strange Elf</strong>. This player character is a dusk elf. Finding their kindred should inspire them to either fight Strahd or find a way to save their people.</p>\n<p><strong>Demonic Heritage</strong>. This player character is Izek Strazni's long-lost sibling and wholly replaces Ireena for the function</p>\n<p>of this relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Mystery</strong>. The spell is a 9th level wizard spell that plays with time magic. If restored, it allows the caster to alter a single moment in time up to ten years prior.</p>\n<p><strong>The Moon's Curse</strong>. The hunter that killed this player character's family members is Rudolph van Richten. If van Richten finds out that this character is in Barovia, he may take the time to try and hunt them down to finish his work.</p>\n<p><strong>Host</strong>. The vine is from the Gulthias Tree. Killing the Gulthias Tree - or restoring the Fanes of Barovia if you are using other Fleshing Out guides - kills the embedded vine.</p>\n<p><strong>A Cycle of Death</strong>. This player character is Tatyana's reincarnation and completely replaces Ireena's functionality</p>\n<p>in the campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>A Verdant Treasure</strong>. The gemstone is the third winery gem that disappeared over ten years prior.</p>\n<p><strong>Greenteeth</strong>. Jeny Greenteeth appears later in the module as an evil witch bent on killing the player character. Alternatively, if you are using other Fleshing Out guides, Jeny is a Fane of Barovia who gently guides the players towards her restoration.</p>\n<p><strong>Hunter's Scion</strong>. The monster hunter mentor is either Rudolph van Richten or Ezmerelda d'Avenir, who left when they found secret transport into Strahd's realm. </p>\n<p><strong>Shell</strong>. This player character might earn a soul by impressing or serving some great power, like by submitting to the Dark Powers or by earning the favor of a god like Pelor by defeating Strahd. Where they obtain their new soul will determine its purity or corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Witch Kin</strong>. This player character is the descendant of Baba Lysaga, who thinks of Strahd as her only true family. Should Lysaga find out this character is her kin, she'll fly into a fit of rage and try to kill them immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Strange Romantic</strong>. It's possible that this vampire lover was one of Strahd's spawn that left Barovia for a time. The player character might encounter their ex-lover sometime during the campaign.</p>"},"_id":"7nspiS8q2sLTkJGv","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671046222607,"modifiedTime":1677179641746,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"IND5XNt9wGKBlzJA","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

[TAROKKA PREDICTION] means the instructions that Eva gives the PCs regarding the card (e.g., \"I see a dark room full of bottles. It is the tomb of a guild member.\")</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Her old hands working deftly, the ancient seer removes fourteen cards from the top of the deck, setting them aside. The remaining cards, she shuffles nimbly twice, three times, four.</p>\n<p>Madam Eva sets both decks upon the surface of the velvet table. Closing her eyes, she places her right hand over the surface of the larger deck. The crimson flames dim and swirl in eldritch patterns as her lips move silently, a distant tension spreading through the air. The sounds of the rustling trees and rippling pool beyond the tent's walls begin to dim, the external world growing mute and insubstantial as the space within grows more solid - more real.</p>\n<p>Slowly, reverently, the crone draws three cards from the top of the deck, laying them face down separately on the table, with the second laid between and above its partners. She then moves to the smaller deck, drawing two more cards. The first, she places below the first three, forming a cross. The second, she places in the center.</p>\n<p>The lights of the candles sway like silhouettes, leaning in toward the cards like anxious watchers - yet the air in the tent is perfectly still. No light intrudes through the seams in the tent's walls; no voice rings out in the silence. Shadows and mist swirl at the boundaries of the tent, where the darkness of deepest night dwells - but here, at its center, light yet reigns.</p>\n<h2>The First Card (left)</h2>\n<p>The crone then moves her wrinkled hand to the left-most card - the first. She closes her eyes and tilts her head, as if listening to an unspoken word. The arcane lights swirl and then shift, their colors changing to a deep, piercing blue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She flips the card.</p>\n<p>The cerulean light dances across its surface, revealing an illustration of a muscular figure, clad in spiked leather armor, a malevolent expression on his face. Slowly, he seems to crank a Wheel, his victim outside view. @JournalEntry[qbadikQNcQoxdGCR]{9 of Swords: Torturer}</p>\n<p>Her dark pupils shift from side to side, as though reading from an unseen text.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"T<span style=\"color:#191813;font-style:italic\">here is a town where all is not well. There you will find a house of corruption, and within, a dark room full of still ghosts.</span>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Second Card (top)</h2>\n<p>She moves her hand to the second card, this one at the top of the cross. As she closes her eyes and listens once more, the candlelight flares, its color bursting into a fierce, cheery yellow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She flips the card.</p>\n<p>This time, the light reveals a new illustration: a warrior, clad in a plumed helmet, wielding a viscious looking shortsword and clutching a shield races towards an unseen foe, murderous intent leaking from his shielded eyes. @JournalEntry[xZ8d472qz7Ewbo7K]{5 of Swords: Myrmidon}</p>\n<p>Her eyes stare deep into the shadows that lurk in the corners of the tent.</p>\n<blockquote>Look for a den of fang and claw in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. I see a woman scorned among them. Give her revenge, and you shall recover a source of protection against the devil from Mother Night's clutches!</blockquote>\n<h2>The Third Card (right)</h2>\n<p>She moves her hand to the third card, at the right arm of the cross, her eyelids closing like a trance, her lips pursed in quiet contemplation. The candlelight vanishes, for a heartbeat - and then returns in a nova of fierce, burning white, so pure and strong and clean that it hurts to look at, burns to see—</p>\n<p>Madam Eva's eyes snap open, burning with a fierce determination.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She flips the card.</p>\n<p>The light reveals a third illustration: smoky tendrils surround a gaunt elderly man brandishing a censer. His stern countenance implies judgement, as though he is silently mocking the heretical views from outcasts. @JournalEntry[rBHKsat1jKUehxUa]{8 of Glyphs: Bishop}</p>\n<p>The crone's voice is strong with purpose.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<span style=\"color:#191813\">I see the shrines of murdered gods! The land itself is wounded and requires the aid of Outsiders. Begin your search in a temple of amber.</span>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Fourth Card (bottom)</h2>\n<p>She moves to the fourth card, at the bottom of the cross, and listens once more, tracing small circles across its back as she hums a contemplative note. The magic flames leap and dance upon their wicks, now casting swirling violet embers into the air as the walls of the tent gleam with the shimmer of twilight.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She flips the card, revealing the half-shrouded form of a hooded figure, a hangman's noose dangling empty in the background. The muted roars of a crowd, screaming in bloodlust fill your ears before fading, leaving that haunted feeling of blind eyes searing your very soul. <span style=\"font-style:normal\">@JournalEntry[vIMo8nBpNg6AbIly]{Executioner}</span></p>\n<p>Madam Eva leans forward, her lips curling into a half sneer and half amused grin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A lone Vistana roams this land. She lingers no one place for long, but catch her, but catch her and her fierce will shall aid you greatly! Find her in a house of healing that begets only madness.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Fifth Card (center)</h2>\n<p>Finally, she moves her hand to the fifth card - and nearly recoils, her brow furrowing until the wrinkles split her forehead like a trench. Behind her, shadows encircle the candlelight until the light is very nearly swallowed by the creeping dark.</p>\n<p>When next she speaks, Madam Eva's rasping voice is scarce above a whisper.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Her hand trembles above the card for a silent moment - and then deft, ancient fingers reveal its opposite side.</p>\n<p>In the darkness, the fifth and final illustration is only barely visible through the smoke and unnatural murk. A well-dressed man, appearing almost royal in his nobility, gazes into a mirror. As you watch, the image shifts - the mirror shatters, cracks racing to the edges, and a silent scream twists his expression from confidence to horror.  @JournalEntry[3vBrowWUZCkczvqZ]{Broken One}</p>\n<p>Madam Eva slowly exhales.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-style:italic;white-space:pre\"><span style=\"color:#000000;white-space:normal\">One day, you shall have the strength to cofront the devil himself. On that day, seek him deep benath his home, lurking in the depths of darkness, in the one place the mists bid he always return.</span></span>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the last syllable passes her lips, the old woman freezes - and then rocks back in her chair, her eyes rolling until their whites gleam like pearls in the darkness - and then she snaps back, the candlelight burning down to its ordinary crimson glow.</p>\n<p>The sound of the outside world returns - the voices of the Vistani, the crackling of the bonfire, the whisper of the wind, and the lapping of the waves against the shore of the pool. Light, grey and insubstantial, filters in once more through the canvas walls of the tent, and you feel yourselves breathe for the first time since the reading began.</p>\n<p>Madam Eva says nothing.

It was at the age that this 12 year old half elven child stumbled into the village of Magh Meall, no knowledge of where he came from or what had happened to him. Found collapsed in the golden fields of grain that encircled Magh Meall, Caolán was found by priests and nursed back to health for over a month at the shrine, where the inhabitants of Magh Meall honour the Tuatha Dé Danann. While outsiders are permitted to enter the domain for purposes such as trade and travel, permanent residence is scarcely given, however Caolán was permitted to stay as there was little knowledge of the boys origin.</p>\n<p>Without an orphanage present within the village, Caolán was taken in by the Ó Dálaigh  family upon his recovery, Ferghus and Dilys Ó Dálaigh . Ferghus Ó Dálaigh , while regarded as a rather poor smith is an extremely hard and passionate worker, working together with his wife Dilys, an extremely skilled tailor talented enough to make up for Ferghus's lack of income and a temper sharp enough to keep him on task, together the duo run a halfway decent shop in Magh Meall. The Ó Dálaigh  were more than happy to take in the young half-elf do their inability to have children of their own, and for the next 8 years would watch over him. </p>\n<p>Caolán found it difficult to interact with the other denizens of the village, it was not that they acted in anyway rude towards the boy, in fact the majority of the village quickly accepted him. This difficulty not only came from his lack of knowledge in how to properly interact with people, but was also partially due to Caolán's personality of cool indifference and muted emotions, this made it awkward for him to interact with others as he was often brutally honest/no filter and had trouble conveying his thoughts. There were however two people that befriended the young half elf, Tadhg Ó Duinn and Roisin Sheehan, a pair of children a year older than Caolán, who took him under their wing. In Magh Meall, upon reaching the age of 20, during the Lughnasadh festival (harvest), young adults may choose to undergo the Ceremony of the Dagda's Trials to earn the favour of the gods. Those who succeed leave Magh Meall as adventuring emissaries with the goal of earning a place beside the Tuatha Dé Danann in death when they pass into Tír na nÓg. Tadhg and Roisin are two such individuals, spurred on by the stories of great hero's such as Lugh, Cú Chulainn, and Scáthach, the two young human had already been training for years by this point and were well on their way to being prepared for their ceremonies. Not wanting to be left behind Caolán began training with them, however years behind already, the immense gap in skill would be difficult to close. </p>\n<p>For the next 7 years, Caolán, when not helping his foster parents in their work, devoted as much of his time as he could to catching up with his friends in the hopes of succeeding in the ceremony and joining them. It was during this time that Caolán had begun to study the faith of the Tuatha Dé Danann, becoming infatuated by their stories and exploits.</p>\n<p>Tadhg and Roisin passed their ceremony easily, gaining the favour of the gods, preparing to leave the village with the plan being that I would meet up with if I passed my ceremony coming the next year. If was not long after their departure that Caolán's all to common nightmares began to morph into something new, hes walking through a dark forest covered in blood, except that these where not the forests of Elysium, these woods were much darker and felt, much worse, and then he comes upon them, the bloodied corpses of Tadhg and Roisin. These dreams felt so real, often waking up Caolán in the night with a sick inescapable feeling in his stomach, motivating Caolán to work even harder.</p>\n<p>Even now with years of study, Caolán found himself lacking compared to his companions, the possibility of failure sitting painfully in the back of his mind. With only a year left, Caolán had to find a way to drastically improve his combat skills, to do so he would have to seek help from someone who had passed the test previously, Scáthach. Scáthach, know as \"the shadow\", lived apart from the rest of Magh Meall on an island known as Cuillin across the river Oceanus but still within the domain. Previously the Tadhg and Roisin had approached the hero asking her to train them and they were denied. Scáthach found the constantly positive outlook of the other villagers tiring, years of adventuring, fighting, and the lost of her party mates had forged a stubbornly cynical personality, so maybe it was because Caolán did not share that same happy attitude that the other had, or perhaps Scáthach was simply bored and found the thought of training the young half-elf amusing. For the next year Scáthach taught Caolán how to fight with short sword and scabbard, the only weapons suitable for his small frame and build, and how to weave magic into his techniques. However the most useful lessons Scáthach gave Caolán, were those that she had learned on her journey, that the world is a brutal place full of monsters and painful. The training was brutal far more so than anything the trio had done together in preparation, so much so that Caolán fell unconscious for days at a time due to the strain. It was during these times of unconsciousness that a new confusing dream had begun to haunt Caolán's sleep, these weren't the horrible dreams of his past or those of his dead friends (much to his relief), he saw only the faintly visible face of an old women and a location, and a town Scáthach told me to be Phandalin.</p>\n<p>This year of intense work had managed to pay off, when the Lughnasadh festival came in his 20th year, and after the festivities celebrating the plentiful harvest , Caolán was permitted to participate in the ceremony along with two other young adults. The Ceremony of the Dagda's Trials tests the abilities of the participants by placing them in a trance/dreaming state, where they are put through various situations requiring all of their capabilities to complete. The trials requiring a knowledge of various subjects or problem solving skills were a breeze for Caolán, however even with the harsh training given to him by Scáthach, he barely succeeded in the combat trials. Upon awakening (hours after the trial had ended) he discovered he passed only by the skin of his teeth, neither the other two participants had succeeded at all. Given a steel necklace of the interlocking holy symbols of the members of the Tuatha Dé Danann given to all who pass the trials as mark the gods favour.</p>\n<p>Now with the permission of the Tuatha Dé Danann, Caolán was ready to leave Magh Meall to adventure as an emissary of the gods. While one would normally feel excited, Caolán felt uneasy, the thoughts of his dreams; his friends bloodied and dying beneath him, and the visage of strange woman, haunting his thoughts. It is to be his first task to find if there was any truth within these dreams, and to do that he must follow the only lead they had given him, the town of Phandalin situated on material plane. Before his departure, his foster parents gifted him with equipment, his mother Dilys gave to him armour of studded leather and beautifully crafted wizards coat of brown cloth with accents of tartan, adorned with brass symbols of our faith such as the triskele and trinity knot.

I was a fool… </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The words are crisp and all encompassing, and you hear Strahd’s voice once more merge with the reader’s, the now familiar blackness surrounding you. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The years passed slowly, immortality suddenly no longer as appealing as it once had been. With each passing year, I became more and more isolated from everything that I had once craved. Every month or two, a small group of adventurers managed to come through the mists. I would allow them entrance, and then the games would begin. Every time it would amuse me to no end, watching these “heroes” try to test their mettle against my servants, before trying to come for me. These new distractions were welcome, if tiresome by their own ends.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see groups of adventurers walking through the gates, scenes of them facing undead and other terrors, before seeing them in the castle, Strahd looming over one of their broken bodies. Time and time again, you watch adventurer after adventurer fall, unable to best the vampire.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As the years have passed, I have toyed with the idea of finding a successor amongst those who come to my domain. It is an odd thought, but I too was an outsider who came to these lands. Perhaps it is the exact answer I require, as none of the locals have shown any spark of greatness. Indeed, with every passing generation, I find a handful more of these strange empty shells. I don’t know how these soulless come to be, but I know that they provide no sustenance, no life within their blood. </p>\n<p>Even as the decades became a century, my desperate love and desire for my Tatyana has never waned. The gleam in her eyes was like warm sunlight on a still pond. That light is gone forever. When I try to imagine her eyes, all I see is the mad abyss filled with mists that swallowed her. In an effort to distract myself, I have taken to focusing on finding any arcane secrets that might allow me to break this curse upon me. It was as I was looking into rumors of a long forgotten stash of arcane works that I found myself utterly shocked and astounded as I visited one my towns, Berez.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strahd rides in his carriage, clearly bored as he casually looks out the window into the small town. As the carriage stops he quickly exits, tall and imposing over the man who has come to meet him. He glances down and dismisses the man, allowing Rahadin to deal with the leader of the town, as he watches the town, clearly wanting to leave. He scans the crowd, until stopping at the fountain. He has a look of shock, dismay and even a small bit of horror. The scene shifts and you see a figure sitting on the edge of the fountain, reading a small book to a couple of children.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It could not be, it was impossible. But it was. She had the same face, the same graceful body. The same voice filled with warmth and kindness. It had been more than 100 years, and the woman in front of me was barely more than a young woman, but I could not deny it any longer. The woman was my beloved, she was Tatyana come back to life again. I was absolutely witless from astonishment. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see the woman clearly and note that Strahd is right. Just as before, you see Ireena. Just as with Tatyana, it does not seem to be a woman who looks similar, but truly Ireena in all ways. As you watch, you see her smile at one of the children gathered in front of her. She then looks up and seeing Strahd, she smiles, though the smile falters for a brief moment as he continues to stare at her. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I did not know how, but I had been given another chance. However, I looked around and saw how the people of my village looked at me. They feared me, they despised me. It would be best to gather information before acting, it would be wise not to show these people my interest in my beloved. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strahd looks down at the man who is haggling with Rahadin, and with disdain produces a bag that must be filled with twice the gold that the books he is buying are worth. He drops them in front of the man and raises an eyebrow at Rahadin before getting back into the carriage. The elf quickly gathers the books and piles them into the carriage. You watch as the villagers quickly get back to their own lives and before long night falls. You are in the room of Tatyana or Ireena, or whoever this version is. As she brushes her hair, there is a knock at the window and she jumps before cautiously walking over to the window and gingerly opening. You see Strahd outside, smiling widely, his fangs visible. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> I came to my beloved and after convincing her to let me in, I quickly charmed the answers out of her. She believed that she was called Marina, and had been discovered some ten years earlier, wandering into the village with no memory of who she was. I was unhappy with the lack of knowledge that she had, but I knew I could not waste this chance. I spent a great deal of time that night, slowly searching her mind, and reminding her soul of how she knew me. I drew forth the memories of us walking in Castle Ravenloft together. Memories of her laughing at some joke I had made. I was careful not to remind her of my brother.</p>\n<p>It took several nights, and a couple of feedings, but she seemed to recall our times together. She had fallen in love with me again. As I stared into her eyes, I knew that I was so very close to having everything I had ever desired. I had nothing left to give her but my own life’s blood, but it was hers to take. She would at last be my bride. She would be more powerful than the regular spawn I had created, she would be free, with her own will. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Marina sucks at a wound on Strahd’s chest before he weakly pulls her away from him and lays her down. Marina looks far paler than she had before and you can see a terrible change beginning within her. Strahd looks incredibly weak, watches her sleeping form for a few moments before making his way out the window. He quickly disappears into the forest and reveals a coffin in a local graveyard that he sleeps in. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those fools were smarter than I gave them credit for. They had seen the changes in Marina and foolishly decided to “save her soul”. They acted at noon, when I was at my weakest, after expending much of my energy the previous days giving what I could to Tatyana. I woke instantly, feeling the pain that my beloved was feeling, but I was too late, too weak. By the time I had reached Berez, they had burned at the stake and driven a stake into her corpse before dousing it holy water. I screamed in agony and rage, and as I did the skies began to darken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The smoldering remains of Marina lay before a bonfire, a priest standing over them, praying to the Morning Lord. As Strahd appears, looking as if he is possessed by a crazed demon, the skies begin to darken. The priest quickly begins to chant loudly, calling upon his god, as townsfolk begin to scream and run. Strahd howls and as he does, the wind picks up and the ground begins to rumble. There is chaos as many people try to run, some fall to their knees, begging for Strahd’s forgiveness, and the Priest tries to chant louder, though the look on his face is one of fear. Though it is midday, all light fades, and rain begins to pour from the sky in a downpour. You hear Strahd as he speaks, his words filled with an unfathomable power: “I am the Ancient! I am the LAND! And you have stolen from me what was not yours to take!”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These foolish insects had done the unthinkable. They had stolen my beloved from me. They had killed Tatyana and they would pay. I told them of their transgressions and though many begged for forgiveness, they would not find it here. I quickly used my connection to the land itself and I could feel the river begin its shift. I walked to the priest and slashed his throat with my claws and watched him bleed to death before informing the fools of what their choices had wrought. I transformed into a bat and watched from a distance as the river quickly barreled into the town, flooding and destroying much of it within mere minutes. I caused the waters to rise, ensuring that none who might survive would ever live in this place again.</p>\n<p>As my rage began to abate, I thought about my precious Tatyana’s remains and went to collect them, but as I searched, there was no trace of them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as the cataclysmic display of power kills many of the townsfolk and renders the village of Berez uninhabitable. The village quickly becomes a swamp and as the years pass, all that used to be here begins to rot and fester. There is a soft melancholy wind as Strahd’s voice speaks over this desolate place.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the centuries, I have found my precious Tatyana several times. Her unrivaled soul, unmistakably mine, is reborn among my subjects.  Every time I come close to possessing her, something tears us apart. I have often hunted for my beloved, I have even felt her within my grasp more than once, but she always slips away. She taunts me! What will it take to bend her love to me?</p>\n<p>I curse the gods that took Tatyana from me, their holy names like drops of burning oil on my tongue. The dark powers taunt and laugh as grief and despair wage war in my soul, each vying for supremacy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The vision once more fades to darkness and you hear Strahd’s voice one final time as you return to reality. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But I will not yield. I cannot; not until I make her mine.</p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"6o0D7GeHGBKQEcrU","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672519521433,"modifiedTime":1672519521433,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"PdMHZ5V1HSFSFrUV","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

She decided to walk her own path and break away from the family. Part of that decision came from the bond with the thing that saved her life. Morwena is the middle child and was not as “promising” as her two siblings. </p>\n<p>14.

Do they have a religious affiliation, and if so what is it and how strong?</p>\n<p>Morwena knows of religion, but beyond what the elfs believe she doesn’t think much about it. </p>\n<p>18. What are their major personal beliefs/ideologies?</p>\n<p>Freedom is everything. She will think about her promise a lot and it has shaped her.

I thundered across the land like the wrath of a just god, but the war years and the killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears stone into sand…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you read the words aloud, the world around you begins to sip away and you find yourself falling into darkness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was the eldest child, the prince destined to take the throne from my father, King Barov. I took to the battlefield when I was barely out of childhood, as my father had done and his father before him. It was a hard life, but one I found solace in. The finer comforts were nothing compared with the glory of victory, the rush of defeating your enemy and standing triumphant above their battered and destroyed bodies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you watch, you see armies clashing on muddy battlefields below you, the banners of red and marked with a familiar raven sigil overtaking the others. You watch as the army marches forward over and over again, destroying all who come forward to face them. The scenes melts, and the seasons pass over and over again, until you find yourselves watching the vanguard passing through a heavily wooded section of the landscape.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had received word that my family had been ousted from our ancestral home, an ancient enemy having struck while my father was at his weakest, and my younger brother too young and weak to defend our lands. These enemies, the Dusk Elves, conspired not to take our lands, but instead to end our line. They inspired a rebellion and struck at night, leaving my army all that remained of the strength of my kingdom. </p>\n<p>My father was slain, my brother and my mother fled with the loyal guardsmen that they had left. In my rage and arrogance, I did not think that the culprits would strike at me directly. I was wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see the vanguard is attacked and though they fight valiantly, they are overwhelmed. One figure kills several soldiers before running off into the woods. You follow this figure as he rushes through underbrush and manages to find a place to hide as his pursuers search for him. Hour pass and the sun sets before he rises up and struggles forward, clutching his stomach where he was wounded. It take him more than hour before he finds a encampment which seems to filled with lively music and drinking. He staggers into the firelight and you see Strahd as he collapses to the ground reaching out for the figures, silently begging for help. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was saved by travelling strangers. They tended to my wounds and nursed me back to health. Though they asked my name, badgered me for the truth of who I was, I remained silent, unwilling to admit who I was. I could not be certain that spies where not amongst them, and I was all that remained of the strength of my family. I promised them rewards beyond their imagining if they would help me get home. Unfortunately, I had been deep within the kingdom of the Dusk Elves when I was felled. These strangers, calling themselves Vistani, escorted me home none-the-less and even fought to defend me when the dastardly Dusk Elves sent their assassins for me again. However, I was no longer the wounded soldier I had been before, and I showed them no mercy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd battles the elven assassins, as they fall upon the caravan like wolves. The battle is difficult with casualties on both sides, but Strahd quickly dispatches the elves and helps the Vistani gather their dead and move on as quickly as they can. You watch as the caravan brings him to his army and he reveals who he is to them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I thanked these people and swore an oath to them that they would always be safe in my lands. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd and a mature woman shake hands, the woman cutting both their palms before binding their hands together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“As you have borne me safely to my people, so too shall your people ever be welcome in my lands. You shall be free to travel through my lands as you please, under my protection, until the end of days. I swear this to you upon my word and my blood.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Vistani nod and some remain while most of the other move onward. You watch as Strahd turns back to his army and his expression darkens. He quickly barks orders and you watch as he prepares his army to move forward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had my advisor, Rahadin, tell me the secrets of his people who he had abandoned years ago. With his advice and knowledge of the inner workings of their court, I was able to move my forces into the center of their kingdom and destroy them from within. Though they tried to run, my soldier ensured that they did not escape. I met with their queen and accepted her surrender, along with her life for sparing the rest of her people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd stands in front of a palace and city that has been created from living tress, sculpted with magic into the shapes of the buildings. A regal woman walks forward before standing before Strahd, taking several moments to stare him in the eyes before kneeling before him in surrender. You watch Strahd take his sword and behead the monarch as the city begins to burn around them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My men were overzealous in their need to purify the treacherous elves who had stolen our homelands from us without even claiming it for their own. I turned the surviving Dusk Elves to the Vistani, showing them mercy they did not deserve, allowing them to live amongst those who had shown their worth to me. </p>\n<p>It was after we left their lands that Rahadin told me of a valley nearby that the Dusk Elves had once occupied but that had fallen to the hands of humans. He said that a human warlord now ruled there, but if I wished, we could take the land for our own. I scoffed, but directed my armies to the valley he spoke of. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd gather his army and march northward, sneering at the Dusk Elves who now travel alongside the Vistani, treated as servants and little more than slaves. You watch as his army marches through a now somewhat familiar forest, until he breaks the tree line to see the view of the valley that you once had. You see Strahd behold the beautiful land of Barovia as the sun fills the valley with a golden beauty that you would have never expected.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As I laid eyes upon the beautiful land, I knew instantly that I would take it as my own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The vision fades to darkness as you hear your companion reading the final translated words aloud, Strahd’s voice and theirs merging.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the years, all goodness slipped from my life. I found my youth and strength gone, stolen by years of war and struggle, and all I had left was death. My army settled in the valley of Barovia, naming it for my father, and took power over the people in the name of a just god, but with none of a god’s grace or justice…</p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"QpzjJysX5o3YNDih","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672519521179,"modifiedTime":1672519521179,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"Q8eEyKObf6bRUpSp","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

That I have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes.</p>\n<p>In truth, this “virtuous” calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I felt the weight of time on my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly, must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but whether I shall ever rest in my grave haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.</p>\n<p>I expect that those who think me a hero will change their minds when they know the whole truth about my life as a hunter of the unnatural. Nevertheless, I must reveal, here and now, that I have been the indirect yet certain cause of many deaths, and the loss of many good friends. Mistake me not! I do not merely feel sorry for myself. Rather, I come to grips with a devastating realization: I now see that I am the object of a baleful Vistani curse. More tragically, the nature of this hex is such that I have not borne the brunt of it; instead, far worse, those who surround me have fallen victim to it!</p>\n<p>I have related the tragic story of how my only child Erasmus was taken by Vistani and sold to a vampire. I explained how Erasmus was made a minion of the night stalker, and how it was my miserable part to free him from that fate at the point of a stake. What I have neglected to illuminate before is how I tracked Erasmus’s kidnappers across the land, or how I “extracted” Erasmus’s whereabouts from them.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Vistani took Erasmus with my own, unwitting permission. They had brought an extremely ill member of their tribe to me one evening and insisted that I treat him, but I was unable to save the young man’s life. In fear of their retribution, I begged the Vistani to take anything of mine if only they would withhold their terrifying powers, of which I knew nothing. To my lasting astonishment, they chose to surreptitiously take my son in exchange for their loss! By the time I realized what had occurred, they were already an hour gone.</p>\n<p>Incensed beyond reason, I strapped the body of the dead young man to my horse and doggedly followed the Vistani caravan through the woods, naively allowing the sun to set before me without seeking shelter from the night. Shortly after darkness fell, I was beset by undead that would have slain me, had not their master—a lich—intervened and spared my life, for reasons that I do not completely understand. He somehow detected me and, with his powerful magic, took control of a pack of zombies that wandered in the forest. He spoke to me through the mouths of the dead things and placed a magic ward against undead on me, then animated the dead Vistana and bade it tell me where I could find its people. Unfortunately (I say in hindsight), the plan worked. I found the child-stealers, and my unwelcome entourage included a growing horde of voracious undead that could not touch me, thanks to the lich’s ward.</p>\n<p>When I found the caravan, I threatened to set the zombies on the Vistani unless they returned my dear boy. They replied that he had been sold to the vampire, Baron Metus. Something inside me snapped. I released the zombies, and the entire tribe was eaten alive.</p>\n<p>Yet the story has not ended. Before she died, the leader cursed me, saying, “Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws!” Even now, so many years later, I can hear her words with painful clarity. A short time later, I found my dear Erasmus made into a vampire. He begged me to end his curse, which I did with a heavy heart.

You expect the darkness as it surrounds you. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had thought the simple rites to bind my blood and my power to this land would be enough. They would not stop treason and dissent entirely, but they should have made the people more complaint. They should have dimmed the magics of the druids. By all accounts the land and its people should have come to accept and welcome me. Instead, I was having to fight for every inch of a land I had already conquered. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd’s troops are attacked by the Mountain Folk, both human and goliath, the Forest Folk, groups of druids and other outlanders, and even undead wearing the armor of the Order of the Silver Dragon. His men are usually victorious, but every battle costs them lives and it is clear that this is not a fight they can continue indefinitely. You see Strahd watching one of the battles from a distance in frustration. He turns on his horse and rides back to the way they had been coming. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I spoke to Rahadin, demanding to know the truth of why the blood rites had not worked. He had brought me to these lands, it was not entirely unreasonable that he was a traitor to both his people and to me. However, he assured me that he knew only a few secrets of the valley. He told me of the Temple where ancient and dark secrets lay. Still, this would not explain the people and their resistance to my rule. I soon came up with a brilliant idea. I threw myself into my studies and within a few weeks I had perfected the necessary spell. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd approached the edge of a small village and polymorphs himself into a Vistani child. He watches for several more minutes before wandering over to a group of Dusk Elf children and begins talking to them quietly. He plays with them for a bit before drawing one over to the tree line and asking the elf child questions. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The elf children knew the stories of the old valley, heard the callings of the spirits that lived there. They had no reason to suspect another child, no reason not to tell me all about the spirits of the woods, the Fanes of the land. Three Arch Fey lived within my valley and they rebelled against my rule. They encouraged their followers to drive out the “devil” who had come to their lands. I decided then and there that such insolence would not be tolerated. I had conquered great armies, learned magics forgotten and lost, I would not be unseated by creatures that had lost much of their power and sought to pretend to be gods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strahd as the Vistani child casts a spell over the elf child and storms away. You watch him return to Ravenloft and begin pouring through his books, searching for magic that will aid him. As the nights pass, and Rahadin and his other generals continue to arrive with more depressing news, he becomes more and more frustrated. Finally, he storms up to Rahadin and barks an order at him, before marching to the front door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I knew where the answers would lie, if the magic I sought was not in the books I had collected, surely they could be found in that dark temple. I was right of course and in my studies there, I found rituals which would allow me to conquer the Fanes themselves and bend them and the land to my will. I no longer cared about the nature of the magic nor the rituals, with every passing day these three ladies spit in my face and mocked me. After I gathered what was required, I brought a battalion with me to the Windmill and the Standing Stones behind it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd approaches the Standing Stones and as he does, animals begin pouring out and attacking his soldiers. Strahd orders his men to stand strong as he begins to make gestures with his hands, dark purple light gathering in his hands. Without warning several men and women rush forward and begin battling Strahd’s soldiers. Strahd barks another order and quickly the attackers are captured and dragged from the battle and manacled. Strahd smirks as he looks at each of them in turn and gestures to one of the women, apparently a druid. His soldiers drag her forward, just behind their master. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had to desecrate the ancient sites of the Fanes powers, in the darkest part of the night. The easiest way to do so would be to sacrifice one of their priestesses using a ritual I had found in the temple. I was not unfair though, I gave each of the ladies a chance to bow to me, to grant me their power in exchange for their life. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As he finishes setting up the ritual, he calls out into the night, demanding the surrender of the Arch Fey known as the Seeker, telling them that this is their only chance before he takes their power by force. As the silence rings out in the night, Strahd begins the ritual and slowly tortures the priestess, demanding that she renounce her Ladies. It takes some time, but it is clear that Strahd is experienced in torture and eventually, the woman agrees, sobbing. She bows before Strahd and without warning he kills her before marking himself with her blood. </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd does this twice more, at two more sites. He calls for the surrender of the Weaver and the Huntress, but at each of the Standing Stones there is only silence. You watch as Strahd commits his atrocities, and as he finishes, you feel a change in the air and something shifts. The wind howls in agony and sorrow, rain begins to fall like tears as the sky seems to begin weeping, the earth seems to quake as if it is shaking its head in dismay. Strahd only smiles as he holds up a hand and all three effects stop. He looks to a nearby vine plant and makes a motion with his hand. The vine slowly crawls forward and wraps around the throat of the last remaining Forest Folk who had stood against Strand’s battalion. The plant quickly strangles him as Strangle laughs in victory. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had done it, I was truly the Land now. I had conquered the Ladies and become more powerful than the Arch Fey. As we rode back, I relished in my victory, knowing that none could stand against me and that soon, all of Barovia would fall into line. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strahd rides forth in the dark night, the sun not yet rising. He howls in victory, drunk on power. You hear the answering howl of wolves in the forest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The wolves began to howl. They knew me. All the wolves of Barovia did. That night I knew that the only limits to my power were the ones I imposed on myself. I would not shrink away into nothingness, I was a conqueror, a magician, a champion! </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd heading towards Castle Ravenloft, the bastion silhouetted by the blood red light of the not yet rising sun. The edges of the scenes fade to darkness as Strahd’s voice merges once more with the reader’s. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Barovia was mine entirely, and now I walked the land like a god reborn.</p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"knOiMinxLNN34iz0","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672519521261,"modifiedTime":1672519521261,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"VOA9mOp1QYpenYhx","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

Namely: What is this thing? How do I prep it? How do I play it? And who is this Strahd fellow, anyway?</p>\n<h2>What is Curse of Strahd about?</h2>\n<p>The Curse of Strahd module is a gothic horror adventure for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition. The campaign provides a similar atmosphere to Castlevania, Dracula, or (if you’ve played Magic: the Gathering) the plane of Innistrad. Here, classic horror monsters of every type haunt the woods, mountains, and villages of the dreary and terror-haunted land of Barovia.</p>\n<p>As PCs, your players take on the role of adventurers who are new to Barovia - either because they have been invited there, or because they have been lured and trapped there. Through the course of the campaign, they will have an opportunity to help the native Barovians fight back against predatory monsters, overthrow monstrous tyrants, and gather artifacts to help kill Strahd forever.</p>\n<p>The Curse of Strahd module is the latest in a long line of D&amp;D campaigns that take place in the Ravenloft setting. The first adventure including Strahd von Zarovich was created for Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and each edition since has included a campaign, book, and/or other product exploring Strahd’s realm.</p>\n<p>Please note that Curse of Strahd is a highly roleplay-oriented module. Unlike many other published adventures, the average Curse of Strahd is roughly 60% roleplay, 20% combat, and 20% exploration. However, it’s not a traditional social intrigue adventure - instead, a large part of the module’s content comes from investigating mysteries, exploring character backstories, building relationships with helpful NPCs, and dealing with Strahd as a social antagonist, rather than an enemy combatant. Make sure that all of your players are on-board with this before beginning a campaign.</p>\n<h2>What’s the basic storyline of the module?</h2>\n<p>Curse of Strahd, focuses heavily on themes of corruption, innocence, and abuse. As PCs, your players will have an opportunity to be heroes of the Barovians - or corrupt servants (or victims) of Strahd.</p>\n<p>Nearly all campaigns will begin in the same place: With the PCs finding themselves magically spirited away to Barovia, or by the PCs accepting an invitation to travel there. Upon arriving in the land of Barovia, the PCs may encounter Death House, a haunted house-style prologue that aims to take a 1st-level party to 3rd-level while setting the stage for Barovia’s lore and atmosphere.</p>\n<p>After escaping Death House, most groups will explore the village of Barovia (which shares a name with the kingdom), meeting Ismark Kolyanavich and Ireena Kolyana. Ireena is a target of Strahd von Zarovich, who secretly views her as the reincarnation of his long-lost bride. Ismark will ask the PCs to escort Ireena to Vallaki, the town next door, to keep her safe from Strahd. Ireena will agree to accompany the PCs only if they bury her father, the burgomaster (mayor) of Barovia Village, at the town church. If the PCs accept this mission, they will meet Father Donavich, the local priest, and encounter his son Doru, a vampire spawn and victim of Strahd.</p>\n<p>After leaving Barovia and departing for Vallaki, the PCs are heavily encouraged by assorted NPCs to visit Madam Eva at Tser Pool Encampment. There, the PCs can receive a Tarokka card reading that foretells the location of three artifacts that can help defeat Strahd, as well as the identity of an ally in their fight.</p>\n<p>After departing Tser Pool, the PCs have the choice of several stops along the way to Vallaki. They can visit the Old Bonegrinder windmill and encounter the coven of hags that inhabit it; they can (if they’re feeling suicidal) venture down the old road toward Strahd’s home, Castle Ravenloft; or they can interact with a number of random encounters that you, the DM, may choose to place in their path.</p>\n<p>Once the party reaches Vallaki, the module opens up considerably into a full sandbox. The PCs can stay in Vallaki and interact with its tense political situation. They can undertake a quest to sanctify the local church (and create a haven for Ireena from Strahd). They can accept a mission to recover wine from a nearby winery, or they can depart Vallaki entirely for the quiet mountain village of Krezk. They can also begin searching for the artifacts and ally predicted by their Tarokka reading, which, depending on what you chose, can take them - quite literally - anywhere on the map.</p>\n<p>As the PCs visit additional locations and obtain allies, artifacts, and information, Strahd begins to grow interested in them. He may make occasional appearances to lure Ireena away from the party, or he may attack the PCs to test their abilities. Most often - though not always - once the PCs have gathered all three artifacts and their ally, they will choose to assault Castle Ravenloft for a final showdown with Strahd, killing him for good - or dying in the process.</p>\n<p>Additional community-created content (e.g., the Fanes of Barovia, the Orphanage of Saint Andreal, the sealing of Vampyr, etc.) can add further depth, length, and complexity to the narrative. However, none of these elements are necessary for a satisfying, full-length campaign.</p>\n<h2>What’s the backstory of Barovia? Who is Strahd, and where did he come from?</h2>\n<p>Barovia is one of the Demiplanes of Dread - a territory of the Shadowfell that lies beyond the Raven Queen’s control. Instead, it is ruled by the Dark Powers: amorphous, anonymous beings that capture “Darklords” - powerful villains from the Material Plane - and imprison them in shadowy, mist-filled realms to torment them for eternity.</p>\n<p>Strahd is one of these “Darklords.” In life, he was a general and a prince, conquering lands for his parents, King Barov and Queen Ravenovia. Upon arriving in Barovia, he conquered its lands for his family, slaughtering the Order of the Silver Dragon - an ancient order of knights and paladins - and renamed the valley “Barovia,” after his father. He then built Castle Ravenloft and invited his family - the King and Queen, and his younger brother Sergei, to join him.</p>\n<p>Barov and Ravenovia died before they could make the journey, leaving Sergei alone with Strahd in their new castle. Strahd soon grew jealous of Sergei, who had romanced a beautiful Barovian maid - Tatyana Federovna. Strahd desired Tatyana for himself, but grew bitter as she spurned his advances. He became convinced that his old age and impending death were the cause of her scorn, and sought out a means of immortality to restore his youth.</p>\n<p>After researching dark magic for a time, Strahd journeyed to the Amber Temple - an ancient prison for dark and dead gods in southern Barovia - and struck a deal with Vampyr, one of the divine vestiges locked away within. Vampyr taught Strahd the secret to vampirism, and on the day of Sergei’s wedding, Strahd slayed his brother and drank his blood. When his castle’s guards killed him, Strahd arose as a vampire, slaughtered the guards, and pursued Tatyana until she jumped to her death in the ravine beside Castle Ravenloft. The Dark Powers took note of Strahd’s monstrous acts, and sealed him - and all of Barovia - inside of a Demiplane of Dread, closed off from the outside world.</p>\n<p>Now, Strahd amuses himself by taking consorts, eliminating vampire hunters, and tormenting adventurers who arrive in his lands. Barovia’s closed-off nature has caused souls to be reincarnated, instead of moving to the afterlife - which has driven Strahd to search out Tatyana’s reincarnation in each new generation. Today, he has found it in Ireena Kolyana, a resident of Barovia, and a major focus of the campaign.</p>\n<h2>Which NPCs are most important?</h2>\n<p>Ireena Kolyana: The most recent reincarnation of Strahd’s long-dead love, Tatyana Federovna.</p>\n<p>Ismark Kolyanavich: Ireena’s brother and the new burgomaster of Barovia Village.</p>\n<p>Urwin &amp; Danika Martikov: The owners of the Blue Water Inn and secret members of the Keepers of the Feather, an order of wereravens that opposes Strahd.</p>\n<p>Baron Vargas Vallakovich: The cruel ruler of Vallaki.</p>\n<p>Lady Fiona Wachter: Baron Vallakovich’s main political opponent and a loyalist to Strahd.</p>\n<p>Dr. Rudolph van Richten / Rictavio: A disguised vampire hunter who has come to Barovia to kill Strahd.</p>\n<p>Ezmerelda d’Avenir: A Vistana monster hunter who has come to Barovia to kill Strahd and find her mentor, Dr. Rudolph van Richten.</p>\n<p>Rahadin: Strahd’s dusk elf chamberlain and enforcer.</p>\n<p>The Abbot: A deva sent to save Barovia who has been corrupted and driven mad by the land’s darkness.</p>\n<h2>Which areas should I prepare first?</h2>\n<p>If you’re just starting out the module, read the book cover-to-cover before your first session. You don’t need to memorize everything, but you should have a general appreciation of what the campaign contains and how the different areas and NPCs connect to each other.</p>\n<p>Before running your first session, prepare (1) your campaign hook, (2) Death House (if you’re running it), and (3) the entirety of the village of Barovia. Barovia is fairly small, so it shouldn’t take too long. You should also secretly pre-determine which Tarokka cards Madam Eva will use in her reading, and decide which, if any random encounters you’ll place on the Svalich Road around Barovia. If you choose to run Death House, that’ll also give you an extra 2-3 weeks to prep Vallaki while you run through it.</p>\n<p>Once your PCs reach Vallaki, prepping any individual session becomes far more difficult. I highly recommend using the Lazy DM session preparation method, in which you prepare materials based on the locations and NPCs your PCs are likely to encounter based on their current quests and interests, rather than worrying about predicting exactly what your party will decide to do. You should also re-read any individual chapters (e.g., the Werewolf Den, the Village of Krezk) immediately before any session in which you expect your PCs to travel to that specific location.</p>\n<h2>How can I avoid common pitfalls for Curse of Strahd DMs?</h2>\n<p>Don’t do a random Tarokka reading. Pre-select cards for maximum dramatic impact and to direct your PCs to interesting and isolated locations. There’s nothing worse than a campaign with Clovin Belview as an ally, the Tome and Holy Symbol in Castle Ravenloft, and the Sunsword three feet away in Madam Eva’s wagon.</p>\n<p>Don’t let your PCs persuade Ismark Kolyanavich to come with them to Vallaki. There’s a common problem where parties assemble too many allies, making combat clunky and detracting from the PCs’ accomplishments. Let Ismark stay in Barovia to tend to his father’s estate and to assume the position of burgomaster, and make the PCs escort Ireena themselves.</p>\n<p>Don’t run Morgantha and the night hags at Old Bonegrinder as an immediate combat encounter. They’re incredibly deadly to a low-levelled party, and they’re much more interesting as a roleplay encounter.</p>\n<p>Don’t treat Ireena as a bland quest item. Give her a personality, her own motivations, and her own active goals. Give her a resourceful and helpful attitude and do your best to make her useful and likable to the PCs.</p>\n<p>Don’t run Vallaki as one massive political sinkhole. You should feel free to space out the periods of time between events like the Feast of Saint Andral and Fiona Wachter’s rebellion. It’s pretty common for players to get super fatigued and frustrated after five or six straight sessions dealing with Vallakian intrigue.</p>\n<p>Don’t let Strahd, Rahadin, or any other notable NPCs face your PCs in combat alone. 5e’s action economy will allow your PCs to lock down and destroy any solo enemy. Use encounter building tools like Kobold Fight Club to make sure that no “boss” battle is anything less than a Deadly encounter.</p>\n<p>Don’t roll for random encounters while your PCs are travelling or resting. Instead, choose random encounters that complement the atmosphere of Barovia and foreshadow future plot elements (e.g., the werewolf encounter, the bundle of clothes, etc.)</p>\n<p>Make sure you hold a session zero with your players to clarify what Curse of Strahd is and is not about. Don’t allow Evil-aligned PCs unless you’re comfortable with entirely rewriting large sections of the campaign from scratch (as the campaign lays plot hooks that are only attractive to Good-aligned PCs), and don’t allow lone wolves or antisocial PCs (as the module is heavily dependent on teamwork and roleplaying).</p>\n<p>Don’t radically increase Strahd’s CR to compensate for perceived “weakness.” Strahd’s RAW statblock has its issues - most notably including a massive gap between playing him optimally (near-unbeatable) and playing him suboptimally (weak PC punching bag). But while there’s an argument to be made for bumping Strahd’s difficulty up to CR16 or CR17, try to avoid the CR27 stat block and similar “upgrades” that are floating around. At the end of the day, Strahd is a four-centuries old vampire who rules over a backwater duchy with three towns in it; he isn’t (and should not be) a match for the eons-old demon prince Orcus.</p>\n<p>Don’t give your PCs maps from the module itself; those outright reveal the locations of the Werewolf Den and Amber Temple. There are several better community-created maps throughout the subreddit that can give your players a sense of Barovia’s geography without spoiling the location of major hidden areas.</p>\n<h2>What are some tips and tricks for running Curse of Strahd?</h2>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to TPK! A total-party wipeout doesn’t have to mean your PCs’ deaths - instead, perhaps they’re captured by a powerful enemy, rescued by unlikely allies, or spirited away to Strahd’s dungeons. Curse of Strahd is a perfect place to let your PCs fail forward, rather than ending their stories immediately because they misjudged the difficulty of a single combat encounter. Rather than making them bitter and harming their attachment to their characters, a few “nonlethal” TPKs can give your players a healthy sense of respect and caution.</p>\n<p>Before you start running the campaign, choose what kind of relationship you want Strahd to have with your PCs in the early stages of the campaign. Should he be a shadowy, distant tyrant? A cruel and ever-lurking monster? A suave and cordial patron? There are many ways to develop Strahd’s relationship with the party, and you should ensure upfront that you have a good idea of where you’d like it to start.</p>\n<p>Encourage your PCs to develop flawed or tragic characters, and use your plot hook and/or Madam Eva’s Tarokka reading to link the PCs’ goals and backstories to questlines in Barovia.</p>\n<p>During Session Zero, make sure to check with your players whether they’re okay with certain traumatic or uncomfortable content that Curse of Strahd includes. If they’re not, see what you can to tweak the module to remove problematic elements, or (if they can’t be easily worked around) suggest a different module altogether. A brief (though not comprehensive) list of potential triggers include: child abuse, murder, kidnapping, gaslighting, racism, sexism, torture, mind control, cannibalism, sexual assault, mental illness, animal cruelty, body horror, incest, suicide, drug addiction, and alcoholism.</p>"},"_id":"q7lML5Mw1NLUMFYF","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1677179619615,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"Vkg9lFbs5JPI1g2R","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

The road starts at the Raven River crossroads (chapter 2, area R) and travels seven miles to a gatehouse (areas T1–T3) and a guard tower (areas T4–T6), as well as a stone bridge (areas T7–T9) that spans the Luna River. Wind and snow make the journey treacherous. Without some way to keep warm, characters who aren’t dressed for cold weather suffer the effects of extreme cold at night (see “<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#Weather\" title=\"Weather\">Weather</a>” in chapter 5, “Adventure Environments,” of the <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\" title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\"><em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em></a>).</p><aside class=\"epigraph-with-author\"><p>The road curved and climbed, making a lengthy switchback into this edge of Mount Ghakis. The air grew colder, not warmer, and patches of snow became more frequent until they were unbroken.</p><p>— Strahd von Zarovich<br />in I, Strahd: The Memoirs of a Vampire</p></aside><h2>Ascending Mount Ghakis</h2><p>The journey up Mount Ghakis can be segmented into two parts: the Barovian Highlands, and Mount Ghakis itself.</p><aside class=\"rules-text\"><p>Climate &amp; Hazards</p><p>Weather and environmental conditions in the Barovian Highlands are largely similar to those of the Svalich Woods below. However, due to the greater elevation, the temperature is somewhat colder, often approaching or passing below freezing, and snow is more common than rain. The weather of the Mountain’s Peak is much more severe. The ground is nearly always covered with 1” - 2” of snowfall, and the temperature is far below freezing. As a result, characters who don’t have heat sources, cold weather gear, or magic to protect them are subject to the effects of Extreme Cold (DMG 110). Due to this extreme cold, the following weather and environmental hazards are much more common while ascending the Mountain’s Peak, and may be included as part of any encounter with the DM’s discretion: Strong Wind (DMG 110), Heavy Precipitation (DMG 110), Frigid Water (DMG 110), Slippery Ice (DMG 110), Thin Ice (DMG 110).</p><p><strong>Extreme Cold</strong></p><p>Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.</p><h4>Strong Wind</h4><p>A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.</p><h4>Heavy Precipitation</h4><p>Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is lightly obscured and creatures in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p><p><strong>Frigid Water</strong></p><p>A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.</p><p><strong>Slippery Ice</strong></p><p>Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.</p><p><strong>Thin Ice</strong></p><p>Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 165 (3d10 x 10) pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks.

At upper slopes, these change to needle-leaved, evergreen trees including spruce and pine trees. Beyond the switchback road above Tsolenka Pass, the treeline stops, with the weather growing too cold to support large vegetation. The only flora beyond this point are sparse grasses and low-growing alpine flowers.</p><p>The wild inhabitants of the Barovian Highlands include elk, foxes, goats, wolves, ravens, and rabbits. Ravens and elk do not proceed beyond Tsolenka Pass due to the cold and sparse vegetation, but the other four can be found at all altitudes at any time of year.</p><h2>Areas of the Barovian Highlands</h2><h3>T10. Southern Hills</h3><p>As the PCs begin their journey through the winding hills that lead to Mount Ghakis, the shadow of an enormous bird briefly blots out the light overhead - the Roc of Mount Ghakis. The Roc flies far overhead the PCs, and pays them no mind, focusing instead on transporting the adult cow that it has clutched in its talons. It soon vanishes from sight beneath the dark clouds that encircle the snowy peak of Mount Ghakis.</p><h3>T11. Abandoned Campsite</h3><p>Shortly after bypassing the southern hills and entering the craggy road that winds through the mountains, a PC with a passive Perception of 12 or more can see footprints in the snow leading behind a jagged rock formation off the side of the road. Investigation reveals an abandoned campsite behind the rocks, including an extinguished campfire, a torn and shredded leather tent, and a trio of fur-lined sleeping bags within the tent.</p><p>This campsite was previously inhabited by <strong>Birghild</strong>, the wife of the Mountain Folk chieftain, <strong>Sigrid</strong>; <strong>Kaldur</strong>, Birghild’s ten-year-old son; and <strong>Runa</strong>, a Mountain Folk scout. The two adults had planned to take Kaldur on his first hunting trip, but were slaughtered by a demon known as @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.9Tsi6hiYXmpDXjEM]{shoosuva} in the night.

Frozen Lake</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>An icy fog settles over this frozen lake, which seems to be split by a partially submerged rocky causeway extending across the center. Sounds are muffled, and you feel a sense of being watched.</p></aside><p>Battlemaps for this lake can be found <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/mvj7st/tsolenka_pass_frozen_lake_dragna_encounter_40x30/gvcmdue/?context=3\">here</a> (credit to /u/SnooTangerines5710). The icy fog restricts vision to 60 feet.</p><p>A PC with a passive perception of 12 or above that enters the causeway immediately notices a set of enormous paw prints similar in size and shape to those of a dire wolf. A DC 22 Nature check can identify the prints as belonging to a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.IGhAKL5maYWl3Wq3]{winter wolf}. The prints proceed from the east toward the west end of the lake, parallel to the PCs’ path.</p><p>Halfway across the causeway, each PC must make a DC 10 Perception check. On a success, that PC hears a faint voice calling for help. The source of the voice is a small child struggling to stay afloat after falling through the thin ice - @UUID[Actor.zrqgXSSv3QVU89cf]{Kaldur}, the Mountain Folk boy who fled the abandoned campsite. Seeking refuge from the shoosuva that attacked his guardians, Kaldur fled toward the northern lake, but was soon set upon by a pack of hungry winter wolves that threatened to eat him. He attempted to flee across the ice toward the opposite end of the lake, but fell through and is now close to drowning.</p><h4>Winter Wolf Ambush</h4><p>The round immediately after the PCs make contact with Kaldur (a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.wiosjchqHyizMaRW]{commoner} with 2 hit points), they are attacked by four winter wolves, who <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise\">surprise</a> any PC whose passive Perception does not beat their Stealth check.</p><ul><li><p>One winter wolf attempts to race the PCs across the lake to reach Kaldur, while the other three attempt to slow any would-be rescuers down.</p></li><li><p>If a wolf reaches Kaldur, it attempts to grapple him before dragging him away from the lake. If it is unable to escape from the PCs due to its slow speed and Kaldur’s struggles, it attempts to reduce Kaldur to 0 hit points before fleeing at full speed into the hills.</p></li><li><p>The surface of the lake is covered in <em>thin ice</em>, and each island in the lake is covered in <em>slippery ice</em>; the water in the lake counts as <em>frigid water</em>. (see Climate &amp; Hazards above for more information).</p></li><li><p>When the PCs first kill a winter wolf, the nearest wolf begins to speak to them in broken Common, asking the PCs to give them the child in exchange for guidance to a great treasure. The wolf claims that it is working to return Kaldur to his settlement, and that it assumed the PCs had evil intentions. It shares that the winter wolves serve as “spiritual guardians” to the people of Mount Ghakis. The wolf is lying (Insight DC 9), and will attempt to flee with Kaldur as soon as escape becomes possible.</p></li><li><p>On turn 3 of combat (assuming he is not removed from the water) Kaldur’s strength gives out, and he begins to drown.</p></li><li><p>On turn 4, Kaldur falls unconscious.</p></li><li><p>On turn 5, Kaldur dies.</p></li></ul><h4>Rescue</h4><p>If the PCs rescue Kaldur, he shares a fragmented and terrified version of the attack that took his mother’s life the previous evening.</p><ul><li><p>He doesn’t know what the shoosuva is, but can describe it as a “giant wolf with a stinger like a scorpion’s.”</p></li><li><p>He also asks the PCs to escort him back to Yaedrag. Kaldur doesn’t know the exact way home, but knows that the party must travel north through a forest to get there, and that the entrance is hidden behind a frozen waterfall amidst ancient ruins.</p></li><li><p>If Kaldur makes himself known when the PCs attempt to gain entry to Yaedrag via the tunnel behind the frozen waterfall, the guards automatically allow the entire party in.</p></li></ul><h3>T13. Overgrown Woods</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>As the road progresses northward, it is swallowed up by an ancient, overgrown forest of snow-covered pine trees and towering oaks, rendering the path forward invisible. Fifty feet beyond the edge of the forest lies the corpse of a dead winter wolf. Just beside the corpse rests an old headstone carved with the following inscription: \"Beware the fury of the mountain's daughters. Follow the dragon's gaze and remain on the path.\" Twenty feet beyond this stone rests a small stone obelisk, five feet high and carved on one side with a sigil of the Order of the Silver Dragon that points in the direction of the next marker.</p></aside><p>The dead wolf is carved up by Shoosoova's claws and bloated from the poison of the demon's stinger</p><h4>Obelisks</h4><p>Once, these obelisks marked a clear path through the woods here, but time has caused them to crumble, allowing the nearby vegetation to swallow up any signs of the roadway that once cut through the forest. Now, only the obelisks remain, halfway-concealed by the underbrush that surrounds them. Three additional obelisks lie along the old forest road, each pointing the way toward the next marker.</p><p><strong>First Obelisk.</strong> The first obelisk lies beneath a thorny bramble, and must be located with a successful DC 15 Survival check. If the PCs fail this check, they must each make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw before attempting it again, taking 3d6 piercing damage from the surrounding thorns on a failure, or half on a success.</p><p><strong>Second Obelisk.</strong> The second obelisk lies atop a small mound at the heart of a chill, opaque mist, requiring a successful DC 20 Perception check to locate. On the party's first failure for this check, eight @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.lWQwxNIuwtRWhIiZ]{snow maidens} appear from the mists and attack.</p><p>A battlemap of this location created by /u/SnooTangerines5710 can be found <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/mvvexj/tsolenka_pass_overgrown_forest_dragna_guide/\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Final Obelisk.</strong> The final obelisk, which points toward the exit from the forest, lies in plain sight, but upon a crumbled base of earth that has collapsed from the forest floor onto an outcropping ledge halfway down a rocky chasm one hundred feet deep. A half-ring of small stones around the obelisk matches up with a similar ring toward the top of the cliff, allowing the PCs to easily determine the obelisk’s original position.</p><ul><li><p>A DC 15 Athletics check is required to reach it, and the carved sigil pointing the way forward is not visible except when adjacent to the obelisk. On a failure, the PC attempting to reach the ledge falls to the bottom of the chasm, taking 8d6 bludgeoning damage, but may attempt a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to catch themselves on the obelisk's ledge.</p></li><li><p>Each of these skill checks may be replaced with an alternate skill check or solution (e.g., the Locate Object, Gust of Wind, or Fly spells) at your discretion and/or your PCs' suggestion.</p></li></ul><h3>T14. Ancient Ruins</h3><p>After a half-hour's journey along the road past the woods read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The landscape is dotted by several dozen ancient stone structures. Close to the path, between a crumbled tower and a ruined shrine, a frozen waterfall falls from a two-hundred-foot cliff into an icy stream that flows into a shallow cavern beneath the cliff.</p></aside><p>The ruined shrine honors the the Ladies Three.</p><p>On the opposite side of the waterfall sits a secret stone door (Perception DC 20 to locate) that opens up into a forty-foot tunnel that enters into the hidden Mountain Folk settlement of Yaedrag. The door can only be opened from the inside or with suitably powerful magic (e.g., the Telekinesis spell).</p><p>These ruins once comprised a trading post between the Mountain Folk and the knights of the Order of the Silver Dragon. Even before Strahd's arrival, the knights of Argynvostholt relied on the Mountain Folk for guidance through dangerous weather conditions, and honored the indigenous deities alongside their own as a show of respect. Today, however, the ruins have long since fallen into disrepair, and the surrounding area has become a favored haunt of the @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.9Tsi6hiYXmpDXjEM]{shoosuva}.</p><p>At the north end of the ruins, several icy ledges form a terraced slope up the nearest cliff. Mt. Ghakis' resident shoosuva prowls this area regularly, attacking any creature that breaches the borders of its territory its territory with fang, claw, and stinger.</p><ul><li><p>The shoosuva is a recent arrival to this area, a fact known by the residents of nearby Yaedrag.</p></li><li><p>The Mountain Folk (correctly) believe the demon to be the accursed spirits of sinful mortals who sought the power of the Amber Temple and who were damned and twisted for their hubris.</p></li></ul><h4>Demonic Ambush</h4><p>The first time the PCs arrive in this area, they are set upon by the shoosuva, which attempts to conceal itself amidst the snowy bluffs before attacking the most vulnerable character. The demon is motivated solely by bloodshed, and will not depart combat until all non-demon enemies are dead. It immediately engages the most vulnerable character with its multiattack and relies on its magic resistance and stench to defend itself.</p><p>At the end of the second round of combat, a great roar announces the arrival of the shoosuva, which leaps down to the combatants from atop an icy ledge. It aims to sate its hunger by slaughtering and carrying off the weakest prey present, and attacks by using its tail stinger to paralyze its target, followed by a bite attack in an attempt to reduce its prey to 0 hit points. If the shoosuva succeeds in capturing a creature, it carries its prey away to the Shoosuva's Canyon; if bloodied, it immediately retreats from combat.</p><p>You can find a battlemap by /u/SnooTangerines5710 <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/mwq12d/tsolenka_pass_ancient_ruins_dragna_guide/\">here</a>.</p><h4>Developments</h4><p>If Kaldur or Kasimir are present with the PCs, they can easily guide the party to the secret door behind the waterfall and persuade the guards to allow the party access to the tunnel beyond. Otherwise, a party that has been directed to Yaedrag by Kavan's spirit or Madam Eva's fortunetelling can gain entry with a successful DC 15 Persuasion check; on a failure, the tunnel guards demand that the PCs track and kill the shoosuva in its canyon to the north, returning the beast's head and stinger to prove their worth. The Mountain Folk won't answer or open the door for anyone else.</p><h3>T15. Yaedrag</h3><p>Yaedrag is a small village of no more than one hundred inhabitants, populated entirely by the Mountain Folk of Mount Ghakis. Lying within the crater of a hollow mountainous peak north of Tsolenka Pass, its people enjoy the quiet and safety their isolated location provides. While the vast majority of Yaedrag's inhabitants are human, you may choose to have Yaedrag partially populated by the fading remnants of another species once indigenous to Barovia, such as dragonborn or aarakocra. This is especially recommended if one of your PCs is an isolated member of that species, and is seeking out others of their kind in search of family or a sense of belonging.</p><p>Long ago, the Mountain Folk comprised the hunter and warrior tribes of the People (what the Mountain and Forest Folk call those who serve the Rozana, also known as the Ladies Three), but when the druidic tribes betrayed the Rozana and schismed from their fellows to serve Strahd, the other tribes retreated to the mountains to escape the wrath and sight of the Shadowsworn, their name for Strahd.</p><p>You can find a battlemap of Yaedrag drawn by /u/SnooTangerins5710 <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/mxes3i/tsolenka_pass_yaedrag_dragna_guide_map_40x30_day/\">here</a>.</p><h4>Entry Tunnel</h4><p>The secret entrance to Yaedrag is guarded at all times by six @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.cfx9BcPFzoNlIKlO]{berserkers} and one berserker commander with the statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.XG3QncWO7sCA9ZZH]{gladiator}.</p><h4>Tent Village</h4><p>Nearly all of Yaedrag's occupants live within large conical tents woven of hides from elks and bears hunted among the snowy forests. Most residents work as hunter-gatherers, though many perform specialized tasks such as tanning, nursing, woodworking, or jewel making. Many members of the tribe also serve as warriors and guards, training in the ancient ways of the berserker to defend the village from outside harm and intrusion.</p><p>The tribe trades through barter, rather than currencies, but is glad to accept payments of precious gemstones, high-quality trade goods, and services in place of gold. Should the PCs make their way to Yaedrag without cold weather clothing, they are advised to purchase sets from a local clothes maker.</p><p>The tribe is ruled by Chief @UUID[Actor.FYi9mZ5io5PdCANe]{Sigrid}, a boisterous and proud middle-aged woman trained as a berserker, who resides in the largest and most decorated tent to Yaedrag's south side. Her eldest daughter, Helwa, is currently venturing to the Amber Temple for a coming-of-age ceremony to become the next chief. Her younger son, Kaldur, recently left for his first hunt alongside Brynhilde, Sigrid’s wife, and Chief Sigrid has grown concerned by their failure to return home.</p><h4>Developments</h4><p>If the PCs deliver Kaldur to Yaedrag safely, Chief Sigrid greets them like heroes, permitting them to roam the small settlement as they please. She offers every courtesy with her limited resources, and, if informed of their interest in the Amber Temple, offers to introduce the PCs to @UUID[Actor.sQeVakF1VTnIRyEI]{Elder Ormira} to obtain more information.</p><p>When the PCs leave, Chief Sigrid warns them to be wary of avalanches and goat attacks at Sangzor’s Ridge, as well as the shoosuva and other corrupted demons that lurk the slopes of Mount Ghakis. She offers the assistance of a Mountain Folk scout named <strong>Folkvar</strong> in escorting the PCs to their ultimate destination. Folkvar does not fight in combat except from afar or in self-defense, but can act once per round to give a PC advantage on their next ability check or saving throw made to traverse or survive the wilderness of Mount Ghakis.</p><p>On the next night following the PCs’ arrival, if the PCs informed Chief Sigrid of the slaughter at the abandoned campsite, she gathers the tribe to hold a funeral ceremony for the lost Brynhilde and Runa.</p><h4>Shrine of the Rozana</h4><p>The Shrine of the Rozana comprises a small cavern at the east end of the village, its entrance enclosed within a tall, red-painted tent painted with the symbols of the Ladies Three: the wolf’s head, the tree, and the eye.</p><p>The tent serves as the living quarters of Elder Ormira an old woman and religious leader to the Mountain Folk. Elder Ormira is one of the few living experts on the histories, rituals, and worship of the <em>Rozana</em>, or Ladies Three, and is willing to share his knowledge only with those she trusts. She also possesses limited knowledge of the Amber Temple, including its location, the means of entering through the collapsed passage, the presence and temperament of the arcanaloth and flameskulls, and legends of the lich that inhabits the deeper chambers.</p><p>Elder Ormira is wary of sharing this knowledge for fear that it may encourage others to seek out the Temple in search of the dark power it contains. It is custom for the future chieftain of the tribe to journey to the Amber Temple, accompanied only by their most trusted retainers, and to remain in the temple for six days and six nights, exposed to the corruption within as a means of proving their stalwart courage and resistance to evil.</p><p>If the PCs appear interested in overthrowing Strahd, Elder Ormira shares with them the following information:</p><ul><li><p>Before Strahd von Zarovich - called the “Shadowsworn” by the Mountain Folk - or his predecessors, the Delmoreans, conquered Barovia, it was inhabited by a civilization that called itself the First People.</p></li><li><p>The First People worshipped the Rozana, or Ladies Three - a trio of ancient goddesses that ruled over the land - and made sacrifices in their name, seeking omens and fortune in the entrails of beasts and mortals alike.</p></li><li><p>The Rozana wielded powerful magic, bringing good fortune to those that followed their ways.</p></li><li><p>Only their most devout priests knew the Ladies’ names; to all others, they were known as the Weaver, the Huntress, and the Seeker.</p></li><li><p>For as long as they ruled the land (known in those days as Cerrunos), the Ladies acted as its sovereigns, making their will known through auguries and omens. Through intermediaries, they wielded powerful magic, drawing power from water, earth, and air. It was said that the Ladies could hear everything that happened in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives, and bring blessings as well as curses.</p></li><li><p>When the men of Delmor first invaded Cerrunos, the druids and berserkers fought bravely in defense of their ancient land. Even so, the technology of iron and steel drove the native warriors back to the mountains and wild places, where they hid from the wrath of the Delmoreans. Worship of the Ladies continued, but with fewer followers and more doubt than before. Many amongst the tribes believed their failure to drive out the invaders to be a punishment sent by the Ladies for their failures and flaws. In their oral histories, the First People’s failure to serve the Ladies adequately became known as the Second Betrayal.</p></li><li><p>Two hundred years later, a haughty warlord named Strahd von Zarovich conquered the fledgling kingdom of Delmor. Fearful, yet optimistic that Zarovich could yet be their savior, the druids of the forest approached him soon after his coronation. They offered him forbidden secrets - hidden knowledge that would bind his power to the land, if only he would promise them patronage and safety. Strahd, his interest piqued, accepted.</p></li><li><p>Thrice did the druids of old Cerrunos guide Strahd von Zarovich, mortal that he was, to the Fanes of the Ladies Three. As he stood in these sanctums and felt their primal, ancient magic, Strahd became determined that these, too, must be conquered. In the Swamp Fane, temple of the reclusive Weaver; in the Forest Fane, home of the wise Huntress; and in the Mountain Fane, home of the mystic Seeker, Strahd re-consecrated each stone altar to his own image, sealing rites of blood and powerful magic that bound his soul to the magic of the Ladies - and so became the Land.</p></li><li><p>The druids, desperate for a protector, were silent in the face of this profane desecration; the warrior tribes, however, saw it as blasphemy, and separated from the company of the druids in disgust. This became known as the Third Betrayal.</p></li><li><p>Today, the Ladies and their rituals are lost to time and mist, the power of the Rozana bound by Strahd’s desecrations.</p></li><li><p>Elder Ormira and those that preceded her believe from ancient prophecies that the Fanes can still be cleansed of Strahd’s taint, restoring the Ladies to power and greatly weakening Zarovich’s defenses and his connection to the land. However, the locations of these Fanes were once guarded fiercely by the druidic tribes, and the Mountain Folk only know the location of the Mountain Fane, which lies beneath the Gulthias Tree on Yester Hill.</p></li></ul><p>If they appear amenable to restoring the power of the Rozana and freeing the land of Barovia from Strahd’s bindings, Elder Omir asks the PCs to journey to Yester Hill in order to cleanse the Mountain Fane of the Shadowsworn’s taint and to learn how the Forest Fane and Swamp Fane might be restored, wherever they may be found.</p><h3>T16. Shoosuva's Canyon</h3><p>North of Yaedrag, a half-hour’s walk from Tsolenka Pass, the road passes between two craggy cliffs covered in snow and slick with ice. This is Shoosuva’s Canyon, the lair of the corrupted beast shoosuva, and a necessary pass for any creature aiming to climb Mount Ghakis.</p><p>A PC with a passive Perception of 15 or higher can hear soft moans emanating from several crags of the canyon. As the PCs proceed down the path, several mounds of snow occasionally swirl in the wind, forming eddies that whirl for several seconds before settling back down.</p><p>Two hundred feet down the canyon and twenty feet off the ground lies the shoosuva’s lair: a large, dark single-roomed cavern containing spoiled straw, old gnawed bones, shredded and rotted fabric, and a reflective surface formed of ice. The icy mirror is gouged with deep claw marks and a battleaxe has been slammed into the wall beside it, the blade embedded into the stone of the cavern wall.</p><p>The cave itself is accessible by a wide ledge that winds from the floor of the canyon to the cavern’s mouth. The first time that a PC approaches this ledge, they are attacked by a shoosuva, which strikes with surprise against any characters whose passive Perception is lower than the shoosuva’s Stealth check.

Gatehouse Portcullis</h3><p>When the characters approach from the west, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The shelf of rock on which the mountain road clings grows narrow. To your left, the icy cliffs rise sharply toward dark, rolling clouds. To your right, the ground falls away into a sea of fog. Ahead, through the wind and snow, you see a high wall of black stone lined with spikes and topped by statues of demonic vultures with horned heads. Set in the center of the wall is a closed iron portcullis, behind which burns a curtain of green flame.</p><p>On the other side of the dark wall, gripping the mountain’s edge, is a guard tower of white stone topped by golden statues of mighty warriors.</p></aside><p>The gatehouse is 30 feet high. The adjoining walls are 20 feet high and lined with stone spikes. If the characters circumvent the gate by flying or climbing over it, the statues on the gatehouse (area T2) animate and attack.</p><p>If the characters approach within 10 feet of the portcullis, it shrieks with the sound of metal on metal as it rises on its own. It stays open for 1 minute, then closes.</p><h3>T2. Demon Statues</h3><p>These statues are actually two petrified vrocks. If they are attacked, or if the characters bypass the gatehouse, the vrocks revert to flesh and attack, pursuing prey that flees and fighting until slain.</p><h3>T3. Curtain of Green Flame</h3><p>A curtain of green flame fills the eastern archway of the gatehouse. Any creature that enters the curtain for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the green flame takes 33 (6d10) fire damage.</p><p>A successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) suppresses the curtain for 1 minute. The curtain is also suppressed within an antimagic field.</p><h3>T4. Guard Tower, Ground Floor</h3><p>The tower door is made of ironbound wood and barred from within. A character can force open the door with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A cold hearth stands across from the door, the wind howling down its chimney. A stone staircase is on the south wall. Three windows look out over a foggy sea.</p></aside><p>The stairs climb 20 feet to area T5.</p><h4>Teleport Destination</h4><p>Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked X on the map.</p><h3>T5. Guard Tower, Upper Floor</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The upper level of the tower is an icebox with windows set in almost every wall. A rusted iron ladder bolted to the floor and ceiling leads up to a wooden trapdoor. Mounted above the stone hearth is a dire wolf’s head. The wind coming down the chimney howls in its stead.</p></aside><p>The trapdoor in the ceiling pushes open with a squeal, revealing the rooftop (area T6) and the stormy gray sky.</p><h3>T6. Guard Tower Rooftop</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Ten-foot-tall, gold-plated statues stand atop the battlements, facing outward. Each one depicts a female human knight holding a lance. The cold wind stirs the snow, under which you see human skeletons clad in rusty mail.</p></aside><p>The roof is 40 feet high and 540 feet above the misty valley below. A wooden trapdoor in the floor squeals as it is pulled open, revealing area T5 below.</p><p>The skeletons are the remains of four guards who held this post long ago. Characters who search the remains find tattered bits of cloth, broken longbows and arrows, rusted blades in ruined sheaths, and rusty chain mail.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The swirling snow assumes the forms of thin, young women. The wind howls, “Begone! The treasure is ours!”</p></aside><p>The forms are six snow maidens. Use the specter statistics, with the following modifications:</p><p>The snow maidens have immunity to cold damage.</p><p>The snow maidens’ Life Drain attack deals cold damage instead of necrotic damage.</p><p>The snow maidens don’t speak, nor are they interested in hearing what the characters have to say. If the characters don’t leave at once, the snow maidens attack. When the last snow maiden is defeated, the treasure that the characters seek magically appears in the swirling snow on the rooftop.</p><h3>T7. Western Arch</h3><p>When the characters approach the bridge, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The snowy pass comes to a gorge spanned by a stone bridge. At each end of the bridge is a thirty-foot-tall, thirty-foot-wide stone arch. Atop each one are two statues of armored knights on horseback with lances, charging toward one another. The wind bites and howls like wolves as it passes through the gorge.</p></aside><p>The western arch contains empty guard posts, one on each side of the bridge. These 10-foot-wide chambers provide some protection against the howling wind.</p><h3>T8. Stone Bridge</h3><p>The low walls that enclose the stone bridge have fallen away in a couple of places, but the bridge appears intact. A black-cloaked rider on a charcoal-colored horse guards the middle of the bridge.</p><p>The cloaked rider is a manifestation of Strahd von Zarovich — a grim warning to proceed no further. If the characters interact with the manifestation in any way, the rider and horse disperse like ash in the wind.</p><p>Five hundred feet below the bridge is the Luna River, barely visible through the fog. Though slippery in a few places, the 10-foot-wide, 90-foot-long bridge is safe to cross.</p><h4>RELOADED Tsolenka Pass</h4><p>The first time that the PCs arrive at the bridge at Tsolenka Pass, if Strahd has discovered their location or knows that they plan to journey to the Amber Temple, Rahadin is standing in wait for them at the center of the bridge. Four wights are concealed in the northern archway of the bridge, awaiting Rahadin’s orders to attack with their longbows. Concealed beneath the bridge is Beucephalus, Strahd’s nightmare.</p><p>A strong wind blows across the bridge at all times, and the air nearby is always filled with heavy snowfall (see Climate &amp; Hazards above for more information on wind and heavy precipitation).</p><p>Rahadin has taken it upon himself to prevent the PCs from obtaining access to the Temple, Strahd’s greatest secret. He waits for the PCs to step onto the bridge before attacking, but employs his Mask of the Wild feature to strike from the shadows if the party strikes from afar.</p><p>Rahadin aims to keep the PCs in the open, where he and his wights can easily target them. On each round of combat, the wights move up to their speed toward the PCs, attacking with their longswords once they are in melee range.</p><p>On the fourth round of combat, the Roc of Mount Ghakis appears, acting on initiative count 20. It uses its first turn to attack one of the wights on the bridge, but immediately discards it with disgust after using its first bite attack. On his next turn, Rahadin whistles for Beucephalus and leaps from the bridge onto the nightmare’s back, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane on Beucephalus’ next turn.</p><p>On its subsequent turns, the roc attempts to target the largest, meatiest-looking creature on the bridge with its talons attack. Once it has captured its prey, it rapidly climbs through the air, away from the bridge and toward its nest at the peak of Mount Ghakis. It uses its action to dash unless its prey fights back, in which case it attacks with its bite until the grappled creature is dead.</p><p>If, at the beginning of the Roc’s turn, there are no living creatures present atop the bridge, it shrieks in disappointment and returns to its nest.</p><h3>T9. Eastern Arch</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>One of the statues atop this arch has crumbled, leaving only the hindquarters of the horse intact. The mountain pass continues beyond.</p></aside><p>This arch contains 10-foot-square guard posts, one on each side of the bridge. Both rooms are empty.</p><p>Beyond this arch, Tsolenka Pass hugs the mountainside for three miles before branching north and south. The northern branch leads to the Amber Temple (chapter 13). The southern branch continues to wrap around Mount Ghakis until it ends at the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia (see chapter 2, “Mists of Ravenloft”).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Mount Ghakis","type":"text","_id":"uSDwzggWMVIhXQ8M","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The “Mount Ghakis” segment begins after Tsolenka Pass, and continues up to the Amber Temple (see below).</p><h2>Areas of Mount Ghakis</h2><h3>T17. Sangzor’s Ridge</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This snowy, mile-long ridge overlooks the fog-shrouded Svalich Woods to the south of Luna Lake. Its tall, rocky bluffs are carved with deep gouges, each half the width of a man’s torso.</p></aside><p>The markings are left by @UUID[Actor.JbRUXXHkhvckYtXY]{Sangzor}, the giant goat, which has claimed this territory as its own. See <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/n804xu/tsolenka_pass_battle_map_sangzors_ridge_dragna/\">here</a> for battlemap of this area.</p><p>According to legend, Sangzor has inhabited this ridge for centuries - and its size and sheer toughness both do little to bely those rumors. Sangzor has the stat block of a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.mmH5BILdWAQo1sy5]{mammoth}, but is Large sized, and has the Sure Footed feature from the @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.WSM2kolPZ23JXXCr]{giant goat} stat block. Its thick and ancient hide gives it the Magic Resistance feature, as well as resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks. Its gore attack rams its horns into its target, dealing bludgeoning damage rather than piercing.</p><p>As the PCs travel across this path, a thick snow begins to fall. Sangzor makes a Stealth (Dexterity) check to conceal itself among the white snow before attacking. It prioritizes attacking the largest or most physically powerful PC, but will immediately take the Shove action against any PC standing against the edge of the ridge. Sangzor attempts to flee when bloodied.</p><p>This ridge is also a precarious avalanche zone. Sangzor’s routine ramming of the cliff face has caused heavy piles of icy snow to build up above - and while the goat’s Sure Footed feature allows easy escape from collapses, any nearby adventurers may not be so lucky.</p><p>Each time a creature casts a non-cantrip spell that deals fire, lightning, force, thunder, or bludgeoning damage, or any spell that disrupts the nearby environment (e.g., tidal wave or earth tremor), they must roll 1d10. If the result is equal to or below the level of the spell cast, an avalanche begins.</p><h4>Running the Avalanche</h4><p>Once triggered, the avalanche can be run as a chase sequence (credit to /u/mysteryHLshopper for developing this idea).</p><ol><li><p>The PCs begin the sequence 100 feet in front of the avalanche, and can attempt to flee from the avalanche each turn. The avalanche falls from behind and above, preventing PCs with fly speeds from escaping it without issue. The chase ends after five rounds.</p></li><li><p>Each PC must roll initiative, with the avalanche acting on initiative count 0. Each PC also gains a number of dash points equal to 2 plus their Constitution modifier. Each PC’s turn then proceeds in the following order:</p><ol><li><p>The PC rolls 1d20, and the DM announces the corresponding result on the Complications Table (see below). The PC may use a skill or cast a levelled spell in order to overcome that complication, so long as that skill or spell takes no more than one action to complete. A PC that casts a levelled spell or a PC that beats the corresponding DC automatically overcomes the complication; a PC that fails the DC suffers the complication’s consequences this turn.</p></li><li><p>If the PC has a base speed of 60 feet or higher without taking the Dash action (e.g., due to the Fly spell) or if the PC uses a bonus action to increase their speed (e.g., by spending 1 ki point to use Step of the Wind, using Cunning Action, etc.), the PC runs 200 feet away from the avalanche. Otherwise, the PC runs 100 feet away from the avalanche. If a consequence causes the PC to move at half speed instead, they move 100 or 50 feet, respectively.</p></li><li><p>The PC can choose to expend a dash point to move an additional 200 or 100 feet, depending on their speed. If a PC has no more dash points remaining, they can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; on a success, they move an additional 200 or 100 feet, depending on their speed; on a failure, they gain one point of exhaustion.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>At the end of each round, the avalanche advances 50 feet plus an additional 1d4 x 50 feet. If this movement causes the avalanche to move further than a creature, that creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and becomes restrained. At the end of each turn that a creature remains restrained in this way, it must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take an additional 2d10 bludgeoning damage. When the encounter ends, the avalanche settles, and any restrained creatures cease taking damage. A creature with a Strength score of 15 or more can dig itself out in 2d6 minutes; otherwise, it takes 2d10 minutes for a creature to dig itself out of the snow and debris.</p></li><li><p>Creatures that are proficient in Survival can learn how far the avalanche will move at the end of the current round with a successful DC 10 Survival check.</p></li></ol><h4>Complications Table</h4><p>The table below presents a list of ten types of complications that may affect your PCs as they attempt to escape the avalanche. Each complication must be overcome with a corresponding challenge. Though the table offers a brief list of recommended skill checks for overcoming each complication (e.g., a DC 10 Perception check to overcome a Poor Visibility complication), PCs are invited to be creative with their responses (e.g., casting Gust of Wind to automatically clear a Poor Visibility complication, or casting Fly to automatically overcome a Balancing complication). If failed, each complication carries with it a corresponding consequence.</p><p>@UUID[RollTable.TjCP43CPbuINCgcp]{Avalanche Complications}</p><h3>T18. Blizzard Fields</h3><p>This part of the trail is barren, isolated, and largely flat. It is also prone to blizzards.</p><p>As the PCs enter this area, the constant snowfall grows steadily heavier. The wind picks up, soon crescendoing into a gale that sends puffs of powdered snow swirling into the air. Have each character make a DC 15 Survival check; on a success, that PC recognizes this weather as the beginnings of a potential blizzard, giving each member of the party advantage on their first saving throw and their first ability check in the skill challenge below.</p><p>When the PCs agree to seek shelter from the blizzard, or when the weather becomes too severe to proceed any further, the Escape the Blizzard skill challenge begins (credit to /u/OrkishBlade).</p><h4>Escape the Blizzard</h4><p>This skill challenge has three stages. To complete this challenge without any penalties, the PCs must complete all stages before they reach three failures. On the PCs’ third failure, and on each failure thereafter, each character must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A character that is immune or resistant to cold damage takes no damage from this effect.</p><p>To complete each stage of the challenge, each PC must make a skill check or cast a spell, as described here. At the beginning of each round, each character must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; on a failure, that character makes all ability checks this round with disadvantage.</p><p>Any creature that attempts to fly in the blizzard must land at the end of its turn or fall prone.</p><p><strong>Stage 1: Stay Together:</strong> As the blizzard escalates, the high-velocity winds and icy snow make it difficult to see - and easy to become separated from your allies. The characters swiftly lose sight of their allies and find themselves at risk for becoming lost in the blizzard.</p><p>A PC can complete this stage with a successful DC 17 Perception check, a successful DC 12 Sleight of Hand check to tie the party together using a rope, a Gust of Wind or similar spell to divert the falling snow, a DC 17 Performance check to shout instructions over the screaming winds, or a DC 15 Survival check to track one’s allies through the snow. Other skills or spells may be used at the DM’s discretion and player’s suggestion.</p><p><strong>Stage 2: Find a Shelter.</strong> With the party united, it’s clear that the PCs must find a shelter to escape the elements. At this stage, the PCs find themselves on the edge of the plains, pressed against a dark and craggy cliff that offers little shelter from the wind and biting cold.</p><p>A creature that successfully casts Leomund’s Tiny Hut automatically passes this and the following two stages if they pass three consecutive DC 10 Constitution saving throws; otherwise, the caster takes 2d6 cold damage and must begin again.</p><p>A PC can locate shelter and complete this stage with a successful DC 17 Survival check, a successful DC 15 Athletics check to scale the cliff toward higher ground, a successful DC 17 Nature or Investigation check to identify likely points of shelter within the architecture of the cliff, or other skills or spells at the player’s suggestion.</p><p>Regardless of which skill or spell a PC uses to complete this stage, the party successfully locates a cavern halfway up a switchback trail that can serve as shelter. This is the Bodak Cave (see below).</p><p><strong>Stage 3: Stay on Track,</strong> As the party attempts to make their way together toward the shelter that they’ve located, the players must select one character to lead the way toward their destination. That PC must roll 1d20; the result of this roll determines which obstacle the PCs will face on the path toward their destination, given by the table below.</p><p>After the obstacle is determined, each member of the party must make a saving throw corresponding to that specific obstacle. Each PC that fails the saving throw suffers the corresponding consequence.</p><p>If all members of the party fail the saving throw, the PCs must choose a new leader, who rolls a new obstacle. This counts as one failure for the skill challenge. The process continues until at least one PC succeeds on a saving throw. When at least one PC succeeds on the saving throw, the party successfully reaches the cave.</p><p>@UUID[RollTable.E8LJ7aOAn052Zq6Q]{Blizzard Field Obstacles}</p><h3>T19. Bodak Cave</h3><p>When the PCs first arrive in this cave (see battlemap <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/n8nnss/tsolenka_pass_bodak_cave_dragna_guide_30x40_day/\">here</a>), the blizzard outside continues to rage, casting a deep, bone-chilling cold into the interior chambers. For each hour that the party remains in the first or second chamber of the cave without a fire or similar source of heat, each PC must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the character suffers 2d6 points of cold damage, and that hour does not contribute to the completion of a long rest.</p><p>There is no wood within the cave, but a Create Bonfire spell can be used to repeatedly conjure a campfire for as long as the caster is awake. A PC can also attempt a DC 20 Survival check to range outside of the cave for wet (but burnable) branches and roots, which can be lit with a successful DC 10 Survival check or any 1st-level spell or cantrip that deals fire damage. Other skills, resources, or spells may be used at a player’s request and at the DM’s discretion.</p><p>Alternatively, a PC that ventures forth into the second chamber of the cave can gather enough lichen from the walls to to fuel a campfire.</p><p>If the PCs take a long rest in this cave, the two @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.0cO41K9KpVHz2ly4]{bodaks} in the third chamber emerge to attack.</p><p>The blizzard outside ends the next morning, allowing the party to progress.</p><h4>Entry Chamber</h4><blockquote><p>The cavern entrance is a spacious but barren and earthy room approximately forty by forty feet across. A narrow winding passageway five feet across sits at the back of the cave.</p></blockquote><p>Any creature near this passageway can hear a low moan emanating from the chambers beyond, similar to that of a person in pain.</p><h4>Carved Message</h4><blockquote><p>The second chamber is approximately half the size of the entry. The lower walls and floor are covered in a thick, grey-green lichen, save for a wide black streak of lichen that cuts across the room from the first chamber’s corridor and follows the northern wall around the bend. The black line of lichen is accompanied by a trail of dark crimson that smears across the floor from the entrance toward the rear chamber.</p><p>The southern wall bears a rough, carved inscription written in Common: “THE SHADOWS LIE.” Below, around, and above it, are carved several dozen repetitions of a single phrase in an exotic script.</p></blockquote><p>The repeated phrase is written in Abyssal and reads “<em>Do not accept their gifts.</em>”</p><p>A DC 15 Medicine check shows this to be comprised of blood - scarcely a day old.</p><p>Toward the rear of the room, a narrow opening scarcely three feet across allows passage to the third chamber. This passageway winds an additional five feet forward before opening into a dark corridor.</p><p>Any creature within the second chamber can hear a low-pitched, pained moan emanating from the narrow opening.</p><h4>Bodak Labyrinth</h4><p>This labyrinthine “chamber” comprises several narrow corridors criss-crossing and encircling one another in a maze. The trail of blood leads toward the center of the area, where a large mound of gnawed bones lies at the intersection of two corridors. A dead elk calf is lying against the bones, its eyes torn from their sockets and its stomach gouged open. Closer inspection reveals that the calf’s flesh has begun to slough from its bones, its hide and muscles rotting and its organs scorched a dark, sickly grey. A DC 15 Medicine check can show that the calf’s hide was torn by long, sharp claws; and that its innards appear far more decayed than the freshness of its blood would indicate.</p><p>The labyrinth contains two dead ends, one to the east and one to the west, each one containing a “nest” belonging to one of the two resident bodaks. Both nests are made of rotted fabric, gnawed bones, and a circle of lumpy stones.</p><h5>Entry</h5><p>When a character first enters the chamber, one bodak is eating the calf beside the bone mound, while the other bodak lurks in the western nest. A creature that makes a successful DC 14 Stealth check can sneak up on either bodak without being detected; however, any sign or sound of intrusion immediately places both bodaks on alert, allowing them to immediately active their Aura of Annihilation feature and stealthily move through the cavern.</p><p>The Aura of Annihilation is not obstructed by cover, allowing a bodak to damage any other creature that ends its turn within a 30-foot radius of its location - whether the bodak and its target are separated by empty air or a ten-foot-thick cavern wall.</p><p>In combat, a bodak attempts to stalk its prey, preferring isolated targets that are vulnerable to its Death Gaze. On its own turn, the bodak uses its Withering Gaze to damage the closest target, and uses its high Stealth skill to hide away in the labyrinthine tunnels in response to sunlight or a Turn Undead effect, skulking away to a more advantageous position before attacking once more. Neither bodak will flee the cavern, and both will fight to the death if cornered.</p><h5>Treasure</h5><p>The eastern nest contains an old adventurer’s pack containing 12 blood-stained platinum pieces and 56 gold pieces alongside an ancient, torn letter that reads: “Cassius - I know I’m breaking my promise, but I can’t ignore these visions any longer. If there is a way to bring Mother back, then I have to take it - no matter the risks.” It is signed: “Deirdre.”</p><p>The western nest contains a set of shredded clothes, a crumpled map that shows a path up Mount Ghakis to the Amber Temple, and a purse containing 6 silver pieces.</p><p>Each bodak wears a chain necklace bearing a shard of amber bound to the vestige of @UUID[Compendium.world.curse-of-strahd-journal.V8ypZQRq1mo8NwbF]{Sykane, the Soul Hungerer}.</p><h3>T20. Rimespire Canyon</h3><p>The Amber Temple is concealed by the natural crags of the Rimespire Canyon, whose entrance lies at the north end of the Blizzard Fields. An experienced tracker can locate the entrance to the canyon within one hour with a successful DC 15 Survival check; otherwise, a party that is searching for the canyon automatically finds it after 2d4 hours of searching.</p><blockquote><p>The canyon itself is 50 feet wide, over 200 feet tall, and half a mile across. Its frozen sides are nearly perfectly sheer and bereft of caverns or outcroppings. In the distance, you can see a natural stone bridge spanning a wide chasm.</p></blockquote><p>Rimespire Canyon contains only three structures: a deep chasm that bisects the canyon’s midpoint; the Amber Temple; and the enormous spire of frozen ice that gave the canyon its name.</p><h4>Deep Chasm</h4><p>The chasm is 200 feet deep and 60 feet wide, and its bottom is lined with jagged ice spikes ten feet in height. It runs perpendicular to the canyon, intersecting it at the quarter-mile point, and has no ledges or handholds. (A reader-contributed map for this location can be found here).</p><p>An old and crumbling natural stone bridge five feet across passes over its center, allowing medium-sized creatures to pass over. However, a constant strong wind (see Climate &amp; Hazards above) makes it difficult to keep upright, requiring a creature to make two DC 14 Athletics checks to pass safely. A creature that crawls across the bridge on its hands and knees automatically succeeds on its Athletics check, but a creature that fails either check must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the bottom of the chasm, suffering 20d6 bludgeoning damage from the impact plus an additional 4d10 piercing damage from the ice spikes.</p><h5>Developments</h5><p>After each PC has made their first Athletics check to cross the bridge, if the roc of Mount Ghakis has not already been slain elsewhere, its piercing screech rings through the canyon. An instant later, the great bird’s shadow falls over the party, forcing them to make a decision: to run for the Amber Temple or stand and fight.</p><p>If the PCs decide to fight, the roc—once the familiar of the Seeker—attempts to seize and kill each of the PCs to prevent them from claiming the profane power contained within the Temple. If encountered here, the roc fights until reduced to 100 hit points, then departs to return to its nest.</p><p>If the PCs choose to flee for the Temple, run Flight from the Roc below.</p><h4>The Rimespire</h4><p>The eponymous “Rimespire” lies approximately halfway into the curving canyon. Standing just over 70 feet in height, this single-helix ice structure has stood within sight of the Amber Temple since the temple was first constructed, shedding mass in warmer months and regaining its volume in the winters.</p><p>All of the ground in a 100-foot radius around the Rimespire is slippery ice (see Climate &amp; Hazards above).</p><h4>Flight from the Roc</h4><p>This skill challenge has five stages: (1) crossing the chasm; (2) avoiding the rockslide; (3) withstanding the gale; (4) crossing the ice; and (5) fleeing the spire.</p><p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Crossing the Chasm. The PCs must successfully cross the deep chasm to avoid the roc’s first swoop. Each PC must make a DC 14 Athletics check to cross the bridge as normal; however, a PC may also use magic or different skills such as Acrobatics or Survival (if possessing a climber’s kit or similar equipment) to succeed. A PC that chooses to crawl across the bridge automatically fails this check, taking 4d6 + 9 slashing damage as the roc’s talons rake across their back.</p><p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Avoiding the Rockslide. The roc flies ahead of the party and perches on the side of the canyon, its great weight and enormous talons scraping loose an avalanche of ice, earth, and stone that threatens to bury the PCs beneath it. Each PC may make a DC 15 skill check of their choice or cast a levelled spell in order to evade this rockslide. Recommended skills include acrobatics, athletics, investigation (to calculate the trajectory of the falling rocks), and perception (to spot a path forward through the rockslide). A creature that fails this check takes 2d10 points of bludgeoning damage and has disadvantage on any checks made in the third stage.</p><p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Withstanding the Gale. The roc’s mighty wings summon a forceful gale that threatens to bowl the PCs from their feet. Each PC must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw in order to stand their ground against the oncoming winds; a creature that roots themselves to the ground with a piece of equipment (e.g., grappling hook or battleaxe) or that casts a levelled spell to fortify their position has advantage on the save. A creature that fails this saving throw has disadvantage on any checks made in the fourth stage; additionally, each character that failed must make a Dexterity check. The character with the lowest result suffers 8d8 + 18 piercing damage as the roc slashes at their prone form with its talons and tears at them with its beak.</p><p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Crossing the Ice. Just as the Amber Temple finally comes into sight, the PCs must cross the slippery ice that surrounds the Rimespire. Each PC may make a DC 15 skill check of their choice or cast a levelled spell in order to make their way at full speed across the icy field. Recommended skills include acrobatics, nature (to predict patches where the ice is thinnest), perception (to locate a path covered in snow for greater friction), or survival (to draw on past experiences to avoid slipping). Each creature that fails has disadvantage on any checks or saving throws made in the final stage.</p><p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Fleeing the Spire. The Roc, maddened by the PCs’ ability to evade it, flies blindly toward the party - colliding with and cracking the Rimespire.

Several feelings vie for prominence: anger, betrayal, sadness, and frustration. Her mind flashes back to the paladins trying to exterminate her simply for what she looks like rather than who she is, and that feeling of being persecuted despite being innocent – that unfairnesss of it all – rises to the top of the emotional rollercoaster.</p>\n<p>The room seems to shimmer and go still, as though the very flow of time has paused. Mist rolls into the  room via the upper windows, and the light grows dim around her. The light is chased from the room gradually, leaving a dim space around Lilith while utter blackness roils around that dull radiance. Her companions fade from view, the guards fade from view, and there is utter silence.</p>\n<p>Out of the darkness, a familiar elegant woman glides towards Lilith. Her face is slightly contorted in an expression of concern, her eyes showing faint worry lines and her mouth in a thin smile.  She moves closer to Lilith, and places her hand on Lilith’s shoulder.  The gossamer sleeves fall aside, revealing a pale, thin arm, elegantly manicured fingers adorned with beautiful yet simple rings made from platinum and unadorned with gems, the simple metal reflecting an uncommon grace.  The delicate hand feels cool on her shoulder, it’s light weight feeling incredibly reassuring.</p>\n<p>“Mourn your companion not,” she says in a clear voice. In the silence, you can clearly hear her though the volume would be missed amid the normal hubhub of conversations. “Ilmater is not finished with that one yet – they have more work to perform in this plane.”</p>\n<p>She shifts, squats down in front of you like a parent with a child, somehow gracefully executing the move to appear seamless.  Her gray eyes sparkle as she looks at you, and her expression softens.</p>\n<p>“You have paid penance before, and survived under your own determination. Allow me to aid you in this affront. Use my blessing to escape this injustice, and aid your companions as they, in turn, aid you. This land needs you – there are too many trapped souls lingering in an imitation of life and prevented from death, and you shall be my agent to help those unfortunates.”</p>\n<p>She gently grasps your hand, and pulls your arm out in front of you, turning it so that your forearm is facing up. Suddenly, a black blade slashes across your forearm, dark blood welling up out of the gash. It drips down, leaking into a small vial she’s holding under your arm. The blood fills the vial and she seals it. The gash on your arm instantly closes, the scar fading quickly, as though it never happened.</p>\n<p>She raises the vial, and you can see a dark container decorated by thin white gold or platinum filigree, with a thin platinum chain. She smiles, and leans forward, placing the chain around your neck where it sits gently next to your locket.</p>\n<p>Standing, she places her hands on each of your shoulders and utters some words under her breath. You cannot make them out, nor can you understand the language, but you gain a sense of peace and calm. You have a new awareness on her gift, a Token of the Evening Glory and you already feel attuned towards it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Token of the Evening Glory (Bloodwell Vial +2) </strong></p>\n<p>To attune to this vial, you must place a few drops of your blood into it. The vial can’t be opened while your attunement to it lasts. If your attunement to the vial ends, the contained blood turns to ash. You can use the vial as a spellcasting focus for your spells while wearing or holding it, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your sorcerer spells.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you roll any Hit Dice to recover hit points while you are carrying the vial, you can regain 5 sorcery points. This property of the vial can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The goddess peers at you again, holding your helpless eyes in her gaze, and nods, satisfied. “Do not attempt to free this land by yourself. Fate has led to you others in a common goal; they do not serve me, but that does not mean we cannot benefit from their assistance. They will require your assistance ahead – gain their trust so that they will support you in your time of need.”</p>\n<p>Her expression darkens.</p>\n<p>“The time approaches where you will confront your ancestor. You will need allies. I cannot say any more. This will be your trial to overcome. My blessing and assistance may aid you, but I may not directly intervene.”</p>\n<p>She moves back, and the darkness begins to fade into light, the mists swirling as they start to fade, and her image also fading out of view.  Before she disappears, she calls out a final instruction:  “Seek the shrine by the standing stones, and restore the Fane of the Forest!”</p>\n<p>The room comes back into focus, and you see your companions, the stone floor and walls, the iron bars holding you in, and the panicked and worried expressions on the guards. You feel a sense of resolute bravery and determination in your peaceful state.  </p>\n<p>…. “Lilith?!? Are you okay? You checked out there for a minute!”  You realize Kovu is speaking, her expression one of concern.  Your hands fly to your neck, and nestled next to your locket is a small vial handing off a chain.</p>"},"_id":"uRuV5UVmGiSZ0lm9","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672685771979,"modifiedTime":1672685771979,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"X0yPkF5zlNsKRoKc","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

The serenity of the place was forever shattered when Strahd led a bloody crusade against the enemies of his family that ended here with the slaughter of hundreds. Struck by the scenic beauty of his most recent conquest and eager to escape the shadow of his father’s legacy, Strahd made the valley his home and named it Barovia after the late King Barov, his father.</p><p>The land now called Barovia is no longer part of the world that Strahd once tried to conquer. It now exists within a demiplane formed by Strahd’s consciousness and surrounded by a deadly fog. No creature can leave without Strahd’s permission, and those that try become lost in the mist.</p><p>Strahd allows the Vistani to come and go as they please because he admires their lust for life and their willingness to serve him when he needs them. He also owes an ancient debt to the Vistani people. As a soldier centuries ago, he suffered a grievous injury in battle, and the Vistani tended his wounds and returned him safely to his family without making any demand for payment. The Vistani claim to possess potions that allow them to leave Strahd’s domain, but the potions are false concoctions with no magical power. Nevertheless, the Vistani are willing to sell them for a hefty price.</p><p>Native Barovians have been terrorized for centuries by the one they call “the devil Strahd.” Only a handful of them have the will to oppose him. Barovians congregate in the valley’s three main settlements—the villages of Barovia and Krezk and the town of Vallaki—for fear of falling prey to wolves and other beasts that prowl the woods. Among these people are the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens. Not powerful enough to defeat Strahd on their own, the Keepers readily assist adventurers who find themselves drawn into Strahd’s domain.</p><aside class=\"epigraph-with--author\"><p>My army settled in the valley of Barovia and took power over the people in the name of a just god, but with none of a god’s grace or justice.</p><p>—Tome of Strahd</p></aside><h2>Lay of the Land</h2><p>Rolling thunderclouds cast a gray pall over the land of Barovia. A deathly stillness hangs over the dark woods, which are patrolled constantly by Strahd’s wolves and other servitors.</p><p>The evergreen trees of the Svalich Woods climb the sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. The largest of these peaks is Mount Baratok, with its snow-covered cap and rugged slopes. Baratok’s slightly smaller twin, Mount Ghakis, is mostly bald with tufts of trees here and there. Between these two mountains stands Lake Zarovich, which is fed by streams of ice-cold water pouring down the face of Mount Baratok. On the south side of the lake rests the town of Vallaki, enclosed by a palisade. West of the two mountains, atop a hill, stands the Abbey of Saint Markovia, around which the Barovians built a walled village named Krezk. Between Vallaki and Krezk lie the ruins of Argynvostholt, the fallen bastion of a knightly order called the Order of the Silver Dragon, wiped out by Strahd and his army. East of the mountains lies the village of Barovia, shrouded in mist and bereft of walls and defenses. The dark silhouette of Castle Ravenloft looks down on this village from its perch atop a 1,000-foot-high column of rock known as the Pillarstone of Ravenloft.</p><h3>Mists of Ravenloft</h3><p>A deadly fog surrounds the land of Barovia and engulfs any creature that tries to leave. Even flying creatures are subject to the fog’s effects, which are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>A creature that starts its turn in the fog must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.cspWveykstnu3Zcv]{exhaustion}. This exhaustion can’t be removed while the creature is in the fog.</p></li><li><p>No matter how far a creature travels in the fog, or in which direction it goes, it gets turned around so that it eventually finds itself back in Barovia.</p></li><li><p>The area within the fog is heavily obscured (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.aYmUMcQfSIqYWpKk.JournalEntryPage.9jyye7TeGlY4FRf3#vision-and-light]{“Vision and Light”} in chapter 8 of the Player’s Handbook).</p></li></ul><h3>Sunlight in Barovia</h3><p>By the will of the Dark Powers, the sun never fully shines in the lands of Barovia. Even during the day, the sky is dimmed by fog or storm clouds, or the light is strangely muted. Barovian daylight is bright light, yet it isn’t considered sunlight for the purpose of effects and vulnerabilities, such as a vampire’s, tied to sunlight.</p><p>Nevertheless, Strahd and his vampire spawn tend to stay indoors most of the day and venture out at night, and they are subject to sunlight created by magic.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Alterations to Magic","type":"text","_id":"mh2rmsDfe3kN431w","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The land of Barovia resides in its own demiplane, isolated from all other planes, including the Material Plane.

These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.81AJ6bpCQjRLGhdB]{etherealness} spell and the Etherealness feature of incorporeal undead, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from Strahd’s domain is pulled back into Barovia upon leaving that plane.</p><p>For the purpose of spells whose effects change across or are blocked by planar boundaries (such as @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.IOTrSjMzsdSQ0BW6]{sending}), Strahd’s domain is considered its own plane. Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally in Barovia, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space. Any spells cast within such an extradimensional space (such as that created by @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.4f62g2Yw9wE06JUY]{Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion}) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast in Barovia.</p><p>While in Barovia, characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally—with one proviso: Strahd can sense when someone in his domain is casting such a spell and can choose to make himself the spell’s recipient, so that he becomes the one who is contacted.</p><h2>Cosmetic Spell Modifications</h2><p>At your discretion, a spell can be modified cosmetically to enhance the horrific atmosphere. Here are examples:</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.JgG2B3r2VppFmmkA]{Alarm}: Instead of hearing a mental ping when the alarm is triggered, the caster hears a scream.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.KxiVfJoUEcdFpjzH]{Bigby’s hand}: The conjured hand is skeletal.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.XhroX8uMuuQKZeMr]{Find familiar}: The familiar is undead—not a celestial, fey, or fiend—and is immune to features that turn undead.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.ZER1JhZyKmIMyTdI]{Find steed}: The summoned steed is undead—not a celestial, fey, or fiend—and is immune to features that turn undead.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.oYN8VYgER4H4a6ip]{Find the path}: A child’s spirit appears and guides the caster to the desired location. The spirit can’t be harmed and doesn’t speak.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.aOxiBPxz0Coe1Z3q]{Fog cloud}: Misty, harmless claws form in the fog.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.WfoicZVfTFvi8cwt]{Gust of wind}: A ghastly moan accompanies the summoned wind.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.J5hFBcsAzkMzClWa]{Mage hand}: The summoned hand is skeletal.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.pasidwSsUOU5UXsb]{Maze}: The surfaces of the demiplane’s maze are made of mortared skulls and bones.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.6WyIsX6bocwWTd3x]{Phantom steed}: The steed resembles a skeletal horse.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.3unsyV96HEUwbAkw]{Rary’s telepathic bond}: Characters linked together by the spell can’t shake the feeling that something vile is telepathically eavesdropping on them.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.VvHakIcefWVyevdc]{Revivify}: A creature restored to life by a revivify spell screams upon regaining consciousness, as though waking from some horrible nightmare.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.9fwxqcp2RWrjQMlP]{Spirit guardians}: The spirits appear as ghostly, skeletal warriors.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.rWUh3qrXZkR8X14T]{Wall of stone}: A wall created by the spell has ghastly faces sculpted into it, as though tortured spirits were somehow trapped within the stone.</p><h2>Resurrection Madness</h2><p>In Barovia, the souls of the dead are as trapped as the souls of the living. They become caught in the mists and can’t travel to the afterlife.</p><p>When a humanoid who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life, either by way of a spell or some supernatural means, it gains a random form of indefinite madness brought on by the realization that its spirit is trapped in Barovia, likely forever. To determine how this madness is expressed, roll on the @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.rolltables.XldSH0ZXwUAHeyn8]{Indefinite Madness} table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Barovians","type":"text","_id":"l3XqH3TagsiyI4ny","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>After his armies occupied the valley and slew its inhabitants, Strahd repopulated the area with human subjects drawn from his other conquered lands. As a result, Barovians have a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>Barovians are deeply invested in their homes and their traditions. They are wary of strange peoples and customs. The way Barovians deal with strangers can be unsettling to those newcomers. Barovians have a tendency to stare openly, in silence, thereby expressing their disapproval of anything that isn’t familiar to them. Barovians aren’t talkative with strangers, to the extent of being pointedly rude. Most Barovians have violent tempers that boil up through their customary silence when they are provoked. They also have a social cohesiveness (thrust upon them by their weird circumstances) that can make them act together against outsiders if a Barovian is mistreated.</p><p>Barovians were a happy people once, but their history and current conditions aren’t pleasant. If one manages to win the trust of a Barovian, one has a friend for life and a stalwart ally.</p><img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/712/cos02-02.png\" /><p>Barovian children aren’t happy children. They are raised in a culture of fear and told time and again not to wander too far from their homes or enter the woods. They experience little hope or joy, and they are taught to fear the devil Strahd above all.</p><p>Barovian adults eke out modest livings. With no new wealth pouring into the valley, they trade in old coins that bear the profile of their dark lord, Strahd, as he looked when he was alive. They hide their precious baubles in their houses and dress plainly outdoors, so as not to attract the attention of Strahd or his spies.</p><p>Barovians live within a closed ecosystem. Every Barovian adult is expected to learn a trade or serve a function. Barovians stitch their own clothing, craft their own furniture, grow their own food, and make their own wine. With fewer than three thousand people living in the entire valley, finding the perfect mate isn’t easy, so Barovians have learned to settle for what they can get.</p><aside class=\"rules-text\"><p>BAROVIAN NAMES</p><p>You can use the following lists to create Barovian NPC names on the fly.</p><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Alek, Andrej, Anton, Balthazar, Bogan, Boris, Dargos, Darzin, Dragomir, Emeric, Falkon, Frederich, Franz, Gargosh, Gorek, Grygori, Hans, Harkus, Ivan, Jirko, Kobal, Korga, Krystofor, Lazlo, Livius, Marek, Miroslav, Nikolaj, Nimir, Oleg, Radovan, Radu, Seraz, Sergei, Stefan, Tural, Valentin, Vasily, Vladislav, Waltar, Yesper, Zsolt</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Alana, Clavdia, Danya, Dezdrelda, Diavola, Dorina, Drasha, Drilvia, Elisabeta, Fatima, Grilsha, Isabella, Ivana, Jarzinka, Kala, Katerina, Kereza, Korina, Lavinia, Magda, Marta, Mathilda, Minodora, Mirabel, Miruna, Nimira, Nyanka, Olivenka, Ruxandra, Sorina, Tereska, Valentina, Vasha, Victoria, Wensencia, Zondra</p><p><strong>Family Names</strong>: Alastroi, Antonovich/Antonova, Barthos, Belasco, Cantemir, Dargovich/Dargova, Diavolov, Diminski, Dilisnya, Drazkoi, Garvinski, Grejenko, Groza, Grygorovich/Grygorova, Ivanovich/Ivanova, Janek, Karushkin, Konstantinovich/Konstantinova, Krezkov/Krezkova, Krykski, Lansten, Lazarescu, Lukresh, Lipsiege, Martikov/Martikova, Mironovich/Mironovna, Moldovar, Nikolovich/Nikolova, Nimirovich/Nimirova, Oronovich/Oronova, Petrovich/Petrovna, Polensky, Radovich/Radova, Rilsky, Stefanovich/Stefanova, Strazni, Swilovich/Swilova, Taltos, Targolov/Targolova, Tyminski, Ulbrek, Ulrich, Vadu, Voltanescu, Zalenski, Zalken</p></aside><h3>Souls and Shells</h3><p>Barovians are made of flesh and blood. They are born, they live, they age, and they die. But not all of them—only about one in every ten—have souls.</p><p>When a being with a soul dies in Barovia, that soul remains trapped in Strahd’s domain until it is reincarnated in a newborn. It can take decades for a bodiless soul to find a host, and Barovians who share the same soul over generations tend to look alike. That is why Ireena Kolyana looks exactly like Strahd’s beloved Tatyana—both women were born with the same soul.</p><p>Strahd needs loyal subjects to feed his ego. Barovians without souls are empty shells created by his consciousness to fill out the local population. Although they are physically indistinguishable from Barovians with souls, they tend to be bereft of charm and imagination and to be more compliant and depressed than the others. They dress in drab clothing, whereas Barovians who have souls wear clothes with a splash of color or individuality.</p><p>A Barovian woman, soulless or not, can give birth. A child born in Barovia might have a soul even if one or both parents do not. Conversely, the child of two parents with souls isn’t certain to have a soul of its own. Barovians without souls are maudlin folk who experience fear but neither laugh nor cry.</p><p>Ireena Kolyana and her brother Ismark both have souls, as do all Vistani. Which Barovians have souls and which don’t is left up to you.</p><p>Strahd periodically feeds on the blood of Barovians who have souls, but he can’t draw nourishment from the blood of the soulless. He can tell at a glance whether a Barovian has a soul or is merely a shell.</p><p>If Strahd is defeated, the fog that surrounds Barovia fades away, allowing the inhabitants of the valley to leave if they wish. Only those who have souls, however, can truly leave this place. Soulless Barovians cease to exist as soon as they exit the valley.</p><h3>Barovians and Nonhumans</h3><p>Barovians are human. Although they know that dwarves, elves, halflings and other civilized races exist, few living Barovians have seen such “creatures,” let alone interacted with them.</p><p>Aside from the secretive dusk elves of Vallaki (see chapter 5), the only nonhumans most Barovians are familiar with are the adventurers that Strahd has lured to his dark realm. Barovians thus react to nonhuman characters the same way most humans in the real world would react to elf, dwarf, or half-orc adventurers suddenly walking the streets. Most such outsiders are scorned, feared, or shunned.</p><h3>Barovian Lore</h3><p>Typical Barovians know certain facts, or have certain beliefs, about their existence and their surroundings. This common lore is summarized here. Characters can learn this information after earning a Barovian’s trust.</p><h4>The Devil Strahd</h4><p>About Strahd and vampires, the Barovians believe the following:</p><ul><li><p>Strahd von Zarovich is a vampire, and he dwells in Castle Ravenloft. No one is welcome at the castle.</p></li><li><p>The devil Strahd is a curse placed on the land because of a forgotten sin of the Barovians’ ancestors.

As a measurement of time, each moon begins on the first night of a full moon and lasts a full lunar cycle. A year consists of twelve moons, or twelve lunar cycles.</p><p>Strahd was born in 306. In 346, he inherited his father’s crown, lands, and army. Strahd conquered the valley in 347, finished construction of Castle Ravenloft in 350, and died and became a vampire in 351.

Compared to Barovians, they are flamboyant, dressing in bright clothes and laughing often. As much as they feel at home in Strahd’s dreary land, they know they can leave it whenever they please and aren’t damned to spend eternity there.</p><p>Vistani are silversmiths, coppersmiths, haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entertainers, storytellers, toolmakers, and horse traders. They also earn money by telling fortunes and selling information. They spend whatever they earn to support a lavish lifestyle, display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, and share their good fortune with family and friends.</p><img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/713/cos02-03.png\" /><p>Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder carries the bulk of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group’s travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life. Vistani elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak in cryptic, flowing riddles.</p><p>Vistani families and clans are closely knit. They resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. The Vistani are quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened and are merciless when they believe they must be.</p><h3>Strahd’s Vistani Servants</h3><p>During one of Strahd’s military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group of Vistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. These Vistani not only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, Strahd declared that all Vistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends to the present day. Thus, Vistani can travel freely through the fog that surrounds Barovia, without fear of harm or entrapment.</p><p>Strahd honors his debt to the Vistani in part because he envies the Vistani way of life—the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born from his admiration of them.</p><p>In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, many Vistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king. Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normal Vistani, and their hearts are poisoned with dark intentions. Strahd uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events occurring in lands beyond his reach. These Vistani will lie to protect the vampire, and they fear the consequences of disobeying him.</p><p>When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, Strahd’s Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the information they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventurers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.</p><h3>Vistani Lore</h3><p>Vistani know or believe certain facts about their people and their surroundings. This common lore is summarized here. Characters can learn this information after earning a Vistana’s trust.</p><h4>Strahd von Zarovich</h4><p>About Strahd, the Vistani believe the following:</p><ul><li><p>Strahd comes from a royal bloodline. He died centuries ago yet endures as one of the undead, feasting on the blood of the living. Barovians refer to him as “the devil Strahd.”</p></li><li><p>Strahd has taken many consorts, but he has known only one true love: a Barovian peasant girl named Tatyana. (The Vistani don’t know what happened to her.)</p></li><li><p>Strahd named his castle, Ravenloft, after his beloved mother, Queen Ravenovia. Strangers aren’t welcome at the castle without an invitation.</p></li></ul><h4>The Land of Barovia</h4><p>Vistani know the following facts about Barovia and Barovians:</p><ul><li><p>Strahd conquered this land centuries ago and named it after his father, King Barov. Strahd uses wolves, bats, and other creatures to spy on all of his realm.</p></li><li><p>Barovians are simple, frightened people. Some have old souls, but many do not. The soulless ones are easy to spot, for they know nothing but fear. They have no charm, hope, or spark, and they don’t cry.</p></li><li><p>The Old Svalich Road passes through Strahd’s domain. Three settlements lie on the road like beads on a string: Krezk to the west, Vallaki in the heart of the valley, and Barovia to the east. Strahd has spies in each settlement.</p></li><li><p>There’s an old windmill on the road between the village of Barovia and the town of Vallaki. It should be avoided at all costs! (The Vistani refuse to say more.)</p></li><li><p>It is wise to stick to the road. Wild druids, wayward ghosts, and packs of wolves and werewolves haunt the Svalich Woods.</p></li></ul><h4>Beliefs and Superstitions</h4><p>The Vistani have deep-rooted beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:</p><ul><li><p>The souls of those who die in Barovia can’t escape to the afterlife. They are prisoners in Strahd’s domain.</p></li><li><p>Some Vistani women are blessed with prescience. Of all the great Vistani fortune-tellers, none compares to Madam Eva. If knowledge of the future is what you seek, Madam Eva will tell you your fate.</p></li><li><p>A prescient Vistana can’t see her own future or the future of another Vistana. It is the burden of the Vistani’s great gift that their own fates can’t be divined.</p></li><li><p>Vistani curses are potent, but they are invoked with great caution. Vistani know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave consequences for the one who utters such a curse.</p></li><li><p>Ravens carry lost souls within them, so killing one is bad luck. (The ravens don’t carry souls within.)</p></li></ul><h3>Vistani Curses</h3><p>A Vistana, regardless of age, can use an action to utter a curse. The curse targets another creature within 30 feet that the Vistana can see. The Vistana can’t utter another such curse before finishing a long rest.</p><p>The curse is a repayment for an injustice or a slight. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the curse. The saving throw DC is 8 + the Vistana’s proficiency bonus + the Vistana’s Charisma modifier. The curse lasts until ended with a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.sbYExdenwIIr9tP2]{remove curse} spell, a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.JRX5RDl5kJ4j85yG]{greater restoration} spell, or similar magic. It doesn’t end when the target dies. If a cursed target is returned to life, the curse remains in effect.</p><p>When the curse ends, the Vistana suffers a harmful psychic backlash. The amount of this psychic damage depends on the severity of the curse that was invoked.</p><p>The Vistana chooses the curse’s effect from the options that follow; other Vistani curses are possible. All such effects deal psychic damage to the Vistani who uttered them when they end:</p><ul><li><p>The target is unable to perform a certain kind of act involving fine motor control, such as tying knots, writing, playing an instrument, sewing, or casting spells that have somatic components. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.</p></li><li><p>The target’s appearance changes in a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar on the target’s face, turn the target’s teeth into yellow fangs, or give the target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana it takes 1d6 psychic damage.</p></li><li><p>A nonmagical item in the target’s possession (chosen by the DM) disappears and can’t be found until the curse ends. The lost item can weigh no more than 1 pound. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.</p></li><li><p>The target gains vulnerability to a damage type of the Vistana’s choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p></li><li><p>The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws tied to one ability score of the Vistana’s choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p></li><li><p>The target’s attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM) ends, and the target can’t attune to the chosen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.</p></li><li><p>The target is @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.0b8N4FymGGfbZGpJ]{blinded}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.6G8JSjhn701cBITY]{deafened}, or both. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.</p></li></ul><h3>Evil Eye</h3><p>As an action, a Vistana can target a creature within 10 feet that the Vistana can see. This magical ability, which the Vistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.Gnzc679610YsGLnz]{animal friendship}, @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.GQRlK4lJH3J9P8AY]{charm person}, or @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.MeCNt70QiY3IV3cX]{hold person} spell (Vistana’s choice), but requires neither somatic nor material components. The spell save DC is 8 + the caster’s proficiency bonus + the caster’s Charisma modifier. If the target succeeds on the save, the Vistana is @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.0b8N4FymGGfbZGpJ]{blinded} until the end of the Vistana’s next turn.</p><p>A Vistana who uses Evil Eye can’t use it again before finishing a short or long rest. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against a Vistana’s Evil Eye, it is immune to the Evil Eye of all Vistani for 24 hours.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Areas of Barovia (A-I)","type":"text","_id":"cnWVv7FV8UsySkzu","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>A.

If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, the travel time is halved.</p><h3>B. Gates of Barovia</h3><p>Two sets of these gates exist: one west of the village of Barovia and one east of the village.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.</p></aside><img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/1/714/850/504/cos02-04.png\" /><p>If the characters are traveling on foot, the gates swing open as they approach, screeching as the hinges move. The gates close behind the characters after they pass through. If the characters are riding in Vistani wagons, the gates open in front of the lead wagon and close when the rear one has entered.</p><p>The eastern gates don’t open for people trying to leave Strahd’s domain unless they are accompanied by Vistani. The fog chokes any non-Vistani that passes through the gates or skirts around them when they are closed (see “Mists of Ravenloft” earlier in this chapter).</p><p>If Strahd is defeated, the gates of Barovia swing open, and the road east becomes clear of fog.</p><aside class=\"rules-text\"><p>THE LANDS OF BAROVIA: COMMON FEATURES</p><p>Unless the text says otherwise, the following rules apply to doors, secret doors, locks, and webs in these lands.</p><p><strong>Doors</strong>. A wooden door can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength check, or DC 15 if the door is barred or reinforced in some other manner. Increase the DC by 5 if the door is made of stone, or by 10 if it is made of iron. Decrease the DC by 5 if the door is made of glass or amber, or if the door is weakened in some manner (such as by rot or corrosion).</p><p><strong>Secret Doors</strong>. If there are obvious clues to a secret door’s presence, such as scratch marks on a nearby wall or footprints leading to it, a character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher notices the secret door. Otherwise, finding a secret door requires a search of the area and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><p><strong>Locks</strong>. A creature proficient with thieves’ tools can use them to pick a typical lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A typical padlock can be broken by smashing it with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Webs</strong>. Characters can pass through ordinary webs, including thick cobwebs, without fear of being restrained or slowed down. A character can clear away the cobwebs from a 10-foot square as an action. Webs woven by giant spiders are a different matter; see “Dungeon Hazards” in chapter 5 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide for rules on giant spider webs.</p></aside><h3>C. Svalich Woods</h3><p>Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream.</p><p>If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, they can continue on to the village of Barovia (area E) without incident.</p><p>If the characters are following the road on foot, the party member who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You catch the scent of death on the air.</p></aside><p>The character can follow the stench to its source:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes are torn and raked with claw marks. Crows have been at the body, which is surrounded by the paw prints. The man has obviously been dead for several days. He holds a crumpled envelope in one hand.</p></aside><p>The dead man, Dalvan Olensky, was trying to escape from Barovia with a letter from his master when he was killed on the road by Strahd’s dire wolves. Wanting to return at once to Strahd, the wolves left the body in the woods but have not yet returned to feast.</p><p>The letter in Dalvan’s hand has a large “B” set into its wax seal. The parchment is worn and flimsy. If the characters open and read the letter, show the players “Kolyan Indirovich’s Letter (Version 2)” in appendix F. The letter is dated one week ago.</p><p>Dalvan was instructed to place the letter at the gates, in the hope that visitors would find it and turn back.</p><p>If the characters linger in the woods, they hear a lone wolf howl far off in the forest. Each round, one more wolf adds its voice to the howling, with the sound getting progressively closer to the party. If the characters are still in the woods after 5 rounds of howling, five dire wolves arrive and attack. If the characters are trying to leave Barovia, these dire wolves are joined by a pack of twenty wolves. The wolves and the dire wolves stop their attack if the characters return to the road and head toward the village of Barovia (area E).</p><h3>D. River Ivlis</h3><p>When the characters come within sight of this river for the first time, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley.</p></aside><p>The river is roughly 50 feet wide, with a depth ranging from 5 to 10 feet. Arching stone bridges span the river at two points, one near the village of Barovia (area E) and the other near Tser Falls (area H).</p><h3>E. Village of Barovia</h3><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.DwlPOv1yBJd6KHfR]{Chapter 3} describes the village of Barovia and the gloomy folk who reside there.</p><h3>F. River Ivlis Crossroads</h3><p>Check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area F, unless they are accompanied by Vistani.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>An old wooden gallows creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam. The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: Barovia Village to the east, Tser Pool to the northwest, and Ravenloft/Vallaki to the southwest.The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog.</p></aside><p>The northwest fork leads down to the river and area G. The road southwest leads to area H. The east road leads to an arching stone bridge and continues on to the village of Barovia (area @UUID[.cnWVv7FV8UsySkzu#e.-village-of-barovia]{E}). If the characters are traveling with Vistani, the Vistani lead them along the northwest road to the Vistani encampment.</p><p>The gallows stand atop a rotting platform 5 feet high, with wooden stairs leading up to it.</p><p>Eleven graves are here with blank gravestones. The forgotten people buried here were hanged from the gallows. Characters who dig up the graves find rotted coffins containing moldy bones.</p><h4>The Hanged One</h4><p>As the characters leave the area, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You hear a creaking noise behind you, coming from the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, gray body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly, so that it can fix its dead eyes upon you.</p></aside><p>One random character sees him- or herself hanging from the gallows. The other characters see an unfamiliar Barovian. The corpse looks and smells real, and it rapidly melts away into nothing if touched or moved.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried in one of the graves. For each grave the characters dig up, there’s a cumulative 10 percent chance of finding the treasure.</p><h3>G. Tser Pool Encampment</h3><p>The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.</p><p>The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest’s edge.</p></aside><p>The eight draft horses drinking from the river are used to pull the Vistani wagons and aren’t easily startled.</p><p>If the characters are brought to this camp by the Vistani, their escorts remain at the camp and don’t accompany the adventuring party any farther.</p><p>Twelve Vistani (male and female human bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober Vistani (male and female human bandit captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.</p><p>Although the Vistani in this camp are in league with Strahd, they attack only if the characters provoke them with threats or insults. Otherwise, the characters are offered flasks of wine and invited to join the reverie.</p><p>If the characters linger at the camp, continue with “A Vistana’s Tale” below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the Vistani tells them, “It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you.” The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with “Madam Eva’s Tent.”</p><h4>A Vistana’s Tale</h4><p>If the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you’re standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse. “When the vampire appeared, the wizard’s peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.</p><p>“The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard’s magic couldn’t save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard’s body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away.”</p></aside><p>The Vistana storyteller doesn’t remember the wizard’s name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven’t spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.</p><h4>Madam Eva’s Tent</h4><p>If the characters decide to see Madam Eva, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. “At last you have arrived!” Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips.</p></aside><p>Madam Eva (see appendix D) speaks the name of each party member and makes some reference to that individual’s past deeds. She then asks the characters if they want their fortunes read. If they say yes, Madam Eva produces a worn deck of cards and proceeds with the sequence outlined in chapter 1. (If the characters don’t want a reading of their fates, continue play using the card reading you performed before starting the adventure.)</p><p>Madam Eva might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can’t be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of Barovia from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd’s (see appendix D for details). She does the vampire’s bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never asks for any.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>For each Vistani tent or wagon that the characters search, roll once on the following table to determine what treasure is found:</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.rolltables.mPivNHl02mXAXJoi]{Treasure}</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in one of the Vistani wagons. Madam Eva grants the characters permission to search the wagons if they ask, and any such search yields the treasure.</p><h3>H. Tser Falls</h3><p>If the characters reach area H by following the footpath from the Vistani encampment (area G), read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You follow the river to the base of a canyon, at the far end of which a great waterfall spills into a pool, billowing forth clouds of cold mist. A great stone bridge spans the canyon nearly one thousand feet overhead.</p></aside><p>If the characters are on the high road instead, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You follow the dirt road as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of mold-encrusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog-shrouded pines that blanket the valley.</p></aside><p>The chasm’s walls are slippery and sheer, and can’t be scaled without the aid of magic or a climber’s kit.</p><p>The bridge is slick with moisture but safe to cross. The road south of the bridge leads down the mountainside to area F; the road north cuts through the mountains to area I.</p><p>The gargoyles on the bridge are harmless sculptures.</p><h3>I. Black Carriage</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Even here, in the mountains, the forest and the fog are inescapable. Ahead, the dirt road splits in two, widening toward the east. There you see patches of cobblestone, suggesting that the eastern branch was once an important thoroughfare.</p></aside><p>If Strahd has invited the characters to Castle Ravenloft or otherwise wants to steer them in his direction, add:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Parked at the fork in the road, pointed east, is a large black carriage drawn by two black horses. The horses snort puffs of steamy breath into the chill mountain air. The side door of the carriage swings open silently.</p></aside><p>The two black draft horses are under Strahd’s control. The horses wait for the characters to pile into the carriage if they so desire. There is room inside for eight of them. If they get into the carriage, the horses draw it down the road to area J. The horses can’t be discouraged from their course, not even by a skilled teamster.</p><p>Characters who don’t want to travel east in the carriage can follow the road northwest through a set of iron gates (area B) that open as they approach and close behind them, or the characters can travel south along the winding road to the bridge at Tser Falls (area H).</p><h3></h3>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Areas of Barovia (J-R)","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>J.

Beyond these guard towers is the precipice of a fifty-foot-wide, fog-filled chasm that disappears into unknown depths.</p><p>A lowered drawbridge of old, shored-up wooden beams stretches across the chasm, between you and the archway to the courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining under the weight. From atop the high walls, stone gargoyles stare at you out of their hollow eye sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs above the entry tunnel. Beyond this location, the main doors of Ravenloft stand open. A rich, warm light spills from within, flooding the courtyard. Torches flutter sadly in sconces on both sides of the open doors.</p></aside><p>The drawbridge appears sturdy, but a few of its boards are missing and it creaks and groans under any weight. Each time a creature other than Strahd or a horse that draws his carriage crosses the drawbridge, there is a 5 percent chance of one of its boards breaking under the creature. If a board breaks, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the bottom of the cliffs, 1,000 feet below. If a companion is within 5 feet of the creature and reaches out to grab it, the creature has advantage on the save.</p><h4>Green Slime</h4><p>A patch of green slime (see “Dungeon Hazards” in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) clings to the portcullis in the entry tunnel, and can be spotted with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The slime will not fall on characters entering the castle, but it does fall on the first character who leaves by this route.</p><h3>K. Castle Ravenloft</h3><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.nvUBCs7RENz5Czr1]{Chapter 4} explores Castle Ravenloft, lair of the vampire Strahd von Zarovich.</p><h3>L. Lake Zarovich</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror.</p></aside><p>If the characters arrive along the shore north of Vallaki in the daytime, add:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Pulled up along the south shore are three small rowboats. A fourth boat can be seen in the middle of the lake, with a lone figure sitting in it, fishing pole in hand.</p></aside><p>Each rowboat can safely hold five people. The person fishing on the lake is Bluto Krogarov (NE male human @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.7xiZS3jBz4J3xlb8]{commoner}), a resident of Vallaki. He is in a trance and doesn’t respond to anything or anyone unless attacked. His boat is 400 feet from the nearest shore. Tied up in the boat is a seven-year-old Vistana named Arabelle (LN female human @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.7xiZS3jBz4J3xlb8]{commoner} with 2 hit points and no effective attacks). She is bound with hempen rope, wrapped in a burlap sack, and lying prone so that she can’t be seen or heard from the shore.</p><h4>Roleplaying Bluto</h4><p>Bluto Krogarov is a destitute drunkard. He’s desperate to catch some fish and trade them for wine at the Blue Water Inn. After he was unable to catch a single fish for a week, he kidnapped Arabelle, believing that Vistani are lucky. He intends to sacrifice her to the lake, hoping it will give up some of its fish in return.</p><p>If the characters watch Bluto from the shore for several minutes, or if they row out into the lake to greet him, he tosses the burlap sack into the water, watches it sink, and waits with fishing pole in hand for his reward.</p><p>Bluto is a hollow shell of a man, barely able to understand his own actions. He is unarmed and does nothing to aid or thwart the characters.</p><h4>Roleplaying Arabelle</h4><p>Characters who act quickly can save Arabelle before she drowns. A character on the shore must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to reach her in time. The DC is 10 for characters who took a rowboat out onto the lake.</p><p>Arabelle has alabaster-white skin and raven-black hair. If rescued, she demands to be returned to her family’s camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9). She is certain that her father, Luvash, will give the characters a reward for doing so.</p><p>A descendant of Madam Eva with the blood of Barovian royalty in her veins, Arabelle is unaware of her connection to Strahd. She acts more like an adult than a child. Despite her recent misadventure, she believes that a great destiny awaits her.</p><h3>M. Mad Mage of Mount Baratok</h3><p>This encounter can occur anywhere along the base of Mount Baratok.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>North of the mountain lake, the trees begin their steady climb up the slopes of Mount Baratok, its monolithic presence oppressive at this distance. The ground here is rocky, uneven, and tiring to navigate. Even the wolves avoid this neck of the woods. Soon, you climb above the blanket of fog that engulfs the valley. Dark thunderclouds roll overhead.</p><p>You see an elk standing on a rocky spur about sixty feet away. Suddenly, it assumes the form of a man in tattered black robes. His hair and beard are long, black, and streaked with gray, and his eyes crackle with eldritch power.</p></aside><p>The Mad Mage of Mount Baratok (CN male human archmage) came to Barovia more than a year ago to free its people from Strahd’s tyranny, but he underestimated Strahd’s hold over the land and the creatures in it. After a battle between the two in Castle Ravenloft, Strahd drove the Mad Mage to the mountains and sent the wizard hurling over Tser Falls (area H). The wizard, his staff and spellbook lost, survived the fall and retreated into the mountains, hoping to regain his power, only to be driven mad by the realization that he no longer has any hope of defeating Strahd or freeing the people of the vampire’s damned realm.</p><p>The Mad Mage has forgotten his name and the world whence he came. In fact, he doesn’t remember anything that happened before the madness. He suffers from the paranoia that powerful enemies are hunting him, and that their evil agents are everywhere and watching him.</p><p>Believing that the characters aim to kill him, the Mad Mage unleashes his destructive magic. As he tears into them, he shouts, <em>“You think my magic has grown weak? Think again!”</em> If he is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he shouts, <em>“Tell your dark masters they can break my body, but never my spirit!”</em> He then tries to escape.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, a greater restoration spell cast on the Mad Mage would restore his wits and ends the madness, allowing him to remember that he is none other than @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.L0aFbvkLlZP9x3P4]{Mordenkainen}, an archmage of Oerth and the leader of a powerful group of adventurers called the Circle of Eight. But in this case, the Mad Mage has cast a mind blank spell on himself. As long as that spell remains in effect, his sanity can’t be restored by any spell. If the characters surmise that powerful magic is preventing them from restoring the Mad Mage’s wits, they can, with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convince the Mad Mage to divulge the reason why their spell failed. A character can also ascertain the cause of the spell’s failure with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The Mad Mage’s mind blank spell has a remaining duration of 3d6 hours, after which his madness can be cured normally.</p><p>The Mad Mage has a different spell list from that of the archmage in the Monster Manual, and he has already used one 1st-level spell slot to cast mage armor on himself, one 4th-level spell slot to cast polymorph on himself, one 7th-level spell slot to cast Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion (see “The Mad Mage’s Mansion”), and one 8th-level spell slot to cast mind blank on himself.</p><h4>The Mad Mage’s Mansion</h4><p>If the characters rescue the archmage from his madness, he invites them to his “mansion.” He leads them up the mountain to an invisible doorway that serves as the entrance to his extradimensional lair, created using the Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion spell. There, he provides them with food and sanctuary away from the prying eyes of Strahd and his spies. Characters are free to take a short or long rest, during which time they aren’t disturbed.</p><p>Mordenkainen is familiar with worlds beyond his own. For example, if the characters come from the Forgotten Realms and mention this fact to Mordenkainen, he asks them if they know his old friend Elminster of Shadowdale.</p><p>If Mordenkainen isn’t the party’s ally as foretold in Madam Eva’s card reading (see chapter 1), he declines to join them if asked. With his wits restored, he sets out to find his missing staff and spellbook, leaving the characters on their own. He doesn’t allow them to help him, for he fears they might be tempted to steal either his staff or his spellbook. (Being an adventurer himself, he knows how the lure of powerful magic can bring out the worst in adventurers.) Before he leaves, as a parting gift, the archmage imbues each character with a charm of heroism (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that the Mad Mage is the party’s ally in the battle against Strahd, Mordenkainen can be persuaded to help them once his sanity is restored. He won’t join them on their travels, but he will help them in a fight with Strahd if they have discovered where to find the vampire and how to destroy him.</p><p>With his sanity restored, Mordenkainen can be stubborn and difficult even with his friends, and doesn’t suffer fools. He normally spends more time listening than talking, but when he does speak, his pronouncements are authoritative and not to be questioned.</p><p>The archmage has never had his fortune read by Madam Eva and doesn’t care to, but if he is told about the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, the Tome of Strahd, and the Sunsword, he insists that these items be recovered before he and the party confront Strahd. If Strahd is defeated and Mordenkainen survives, the archmage gladly accompanies the characters back to their world if they invite him, if only not to disappoint them.</p><h3>N.

The top half of the sign, featuring arms pointing in four directions, lies in the weeds nearby.</p></aside><p>The characters can easily figure out how the top half of the signpost connects to the lower half. When the two parts of the sign are aligned and rejoined, the arms indicate Krezk and Tsolenka Pass to the southwest, Lake Baratok to the northwest, Vallaki and Ravenloft to the northeast, and Berez to the southeast.</p><p>The Old Svalich Road, which runs northeast to southwest between Vallaki (area N) and Krezk (area S), is generally level. About a quarter mile along the northeast branch, an arching stone bridge crosses the Luna River.</p><p>The northwest branch of the crossroads climbs gently, becoming a dirt trail through the woods within half a mile. It merges with the Old Svalich Road again after a couple of miles, but not before sprouting a branch that leads to Van Richten’s Tower on Lake Baratok (area V).

The table entries are presented in alphabetical order.</p><h4>Barovian Commoners</h4><aside class=\"read-aloud\"><p>The sound of snapping twigs draws your attention to several dark shapes in the fog. They carry torches and pitchforks.</p></aside><p>If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from these Barovians, who carry pitchforks (+2 to hit) instead of clubs, dealing 3 (1d6) piercing damage on a hit.</p><p>Barovian @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.wiosjchqHyizMaRW]{commoners} rarely leave their settlements. This group might be a family looking for a safer place to live, or an angry mob searching for the characters or heading toward Castle Ravenloft to confront Strahd.</p><h4>Barovian Scouts</h4><p>If at least one character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud\"><p>You see a dark figure crouched low and perfectly still, aiming a crossbow in your direction.</p></aside><p>If more than one scout is present, the others are spread out over a 100-foot-square area.</p><p>These @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.H0OrmGfHHU2VIVgy]{scouts} are Barovian hunters or trappers searching for a missing villager or townsperson. Once they realize the characters aren’t out to kill them, they lower their weapons and request help in finding their missing person. If the characters decline, the scouts point them in the direction of the nearest settlement and depart without so much as a farewell. They wield light crossbows (+4 to hit, range 80/320 ft.) instead of longbows, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage on a hit.</p><aside class=\"rules-text\"><p>STRAHD'S SPIES</p><p>As the undisputed master of Barovia, Strahd has many spies, from swarms of bats to wandering Vistani, who report to him at dawn and dusk each day. These agents constantly patrol the land of Barovia and report everything they see to him.</p><p>Every day and night that the characters remain in Barovia, one or more of the vampire’s spies check on them and attempt to return to Strahd with a report. When a spy appears, characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score equal to or greater than the spy’s Dexterity (Stealth) check notice it. A spy does not constitute an encounter if the characters are unaware of its presence. If they do notice it, the spy’s goal is usually escape, not combat. A secondary goal for a spy might be to acquire some physical object—a possession, an article of clothing, or even some part of a character’s body such as a lock of hair—that Strahd can use to improve the efficacy of his scrying spell. If one of Strahd’s spies is confronted by the party, the spy attempts to grab some accessible item from a character before fleeing. If Strahd acquires such an item, he uses his scrying spell to learn as much as he can about the party before planning his next attack, and to verify what his spies have already told him.</p></aside><h4>Berserkers</h4><p>These wild mountain folk are covered head to toe in thick gray mud, which makes them hard to see in the fog and well hidden in the mountains they call home. While so camouflaged, they have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores are higher than the berserker’s Dexterity (Stealth) check can spot the nearest @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.cfx9BcPFzoNlIKlO]{berserker}.</p><p>If someone spots the berserker, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You startle a wild-looking figure caked in gray mud and clutching a crude stone axe. Whether it’s a man or a woman, you can’t tell.</p></aside><p>The berserkers shun civilized folk. They try to remain hidden and withdraw if they are spotted, attacking only if trapped or threatened.</p><h4>Corpse</h4><p>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You find a corpse.</p></aside><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p>Roll a d6 to determine the nature of the corpse:</p><p>1–2. The corpse belonged to a wolf killed by spears and crossbow bolts.</p><p>3–5. The corpse belongs to a Barovian man, woman, or child who was clearly torn to pieces by dire wolves. If the party is accompanied by Barovian scouts (see above), the scouts recognize the corpse as the person they were searching for.</p><p>6. The corpse looks like one of the characters (determined randomly) but has been stripped of armor, weapons, and valuables. If moved, its flesh melts away until only the skeleton remains.</p></aside><h4>Dire Wolves</h4><blockquote><p>A snarling wolf the size of a grizzly bear steps out of the fog.</p></blockquote><p>The area is lightly obscured by fog. If more than one dire wolf is present, the others aren’t far behind and can be seen as dark shadows in the fog. The dire wolves of Barovia are cruel, overgrown wolves and Strahd’s loyal servants. They can’t be charmed or frightened.</p><h4>Druid and Twig Blights</h4><blockquote><p>A gaunt figure with wild hair and bare feet bounds toward you on all fours, wearing a tattered gown of stitched animal skins. You can’t tell whether it’s a man or a woman. It stops, sniffs the air, and laughs like a lunatic. The ground nearby is crawling with tiny twig monsters.</p></blockquote><p>The Barovian wilderness is home to druids who worship Strahd because of his ability to control the weather and the beasts of Barovia. The druids are savage and violent, and each controls a host of twig blights, which fights until destroyed. If all the twig blights are destroyed or the druid loses more than half of its hit points, the druid flees, heading toward Yester Hill (area Y).</p><h4>False Trail</h4><p>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.</p><blockquote><p>You discover a foot trail that cuts through the wilderness.</p></blockquote><p>Evil druids left this trail. Following it in either direction leads to a spiked pit (see “Sample Traps” in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). A thin tarp made of twigs and pine needles conceals the pit, the bottom of which is lined with sharpened wooden stakes.</p><h4>Ghost</h4><p>A baleful apparition appears before you, its hollow eyes dark with anger.</p><p>Many ghosts haunt this land. This particular ghost is all that remains of a person drained of life by Strahd (decide whether it’s a man or a woman). It appears and hisses, “No one will ever know you died here.” It then attacks. If the ghost succeeds in possessing a character, it leads its host to the gates of Ravenloft (area J) and hurls the host’s body into the chasm.</p><h4>Grave</h4><p>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.</p><blockquote><p>You stumble upon an old grave.</p></blockquote><p>There is a 25 percent chance that the grave is intact, appearing as an elongated earthen mound or a rocky cairn. Characters who dig up the grave find the skeletal remains of a human clad in rusted chain mail (a soldier). Among the bones lie corroded weapons.</p><p>If the grave isn’t intact, it has been violated. The characters find a shallow, mud-filled hole with dirt or rocks strewn around it and a few scattered bones within.</p><h4>Hidden Bundle</h4><p>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.</p><p>The characters find a leather-wrapped bundle hidden in the underbrush, stuffed inside a hollow log, or nestled in the boughs of a tree. If they open the bundle, read:</p><p>The bundle contains one set of common clothes sized for a human adult.</p><p>The clothes have a drab Barovian style to them. They belong to a wereraven or werewolf.</p><h4>Hunting Trap</h4><p>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.</p><p>Have each of the characters in the front rank of the party’s marching order make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. If one or more of them succeeds, read:</p><blockquote><p>You spot a wolf trap, its steel jaws caked with rust. Someone has carefully hidden the trap under a thin layer of pine needles and detritus.</p></blockquote><p>Barovian hunters and trappers set these traps hoping to thin out the wolf population, but Strahd’s wolves are too clever to be caught in them. If none of the characters in the front rank spots the hidden trap, one random party member steps on it. Rules for the hunting trap are presented in chapter 5, “Equipment,” of the Player’s Handbook.</p><h4>Needle Blights</h4><blockquote><p>Hunched figures lurch through the mist, their gaunt bodies covered in needles.</p></blockquote><p>The woods crawl with needle blights that serve the evil druids of Barovia. If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from these blights.</p><h4>Revenant</h4><blockquote><p>A figure walks alone with the stride and bearing of one who knows no fear. Clad in rusty armor, it clutches a gleaming longsword in its pale hand and looks ready for a fight.</p></blockquote><p>From a distance, the revenant looks like a zombie and might be mistaken for such. A character within 30 feet of the revenant who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can see the intelligence and hate in its sunken eyes. The revenant is clad in tattered chain mail that affords the same protection as leather armor.</p><p>The revenant was a knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon, which was annihilated defending the valley against Strahd’s armies more than four centuries ago. The revenant no longer remembers its name and wanders the land in search of Strahd’s wolves and other minions, slaying them on sight. If the characters attack it, the revenant assumes they are in league with Strahd and fights them until destroyed.</p><p>As an action, the revenant can attack twice with its longsword, wielding the weapon with both hands and dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage on each hit.</p><p>If the characters present themselves as enemies of Strahd, the revenant urges them to travel to Argynvostholt (chapter 7) and convince Vladimir Horngaard, the leader of the Order of the Silver Dragon, to help them. The revenant would like nothing more than to kill Strahd, but it will not venture to Castle Ravenloft unless it receives orders to do so from Vladimir. If the characters ask the revenant to lead them to Horngaard in Argynvostholt, it does so while avoiding contact with Barovian settlements.</p><h4>Scarecrows</h4><p>If at least one character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher, read:</p><blockquote><p>A scarecrow lurches into view. Its sackcloth eyes and rictus are ripe with malevolence, and its gut is stuffed with dead ravens. It has long, rusted knives for claws.</p></blockquote><p>If more than one scarecrow is present, the others are close by. If none of the characters has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher, the scarecrows catch the party by surprise.</p><p>Baba Lysaga (see chapter 10, area U3) crafted these scarecrows to hunt down and kill ravens and were­ravens. The scarecrows are imbued with evil spirits and delight in murdering anyone they encounter.</p><h4>Skeletal Rider</h4><blockquote><p>Through the mist comes a skeletal warhorse and rider, both clad in ruined chainmail. The skeletal rider holds up a rusted lantern that sheds no light.</p></blockquote><p>The human skeleton and warhorse skeleton are all that remain of a rider and mount, both of whom perished trying to escape through the fog that surrounds Barovia. They are doomed to ride through the valley in search of another way out, without hope of salvation. The skeletons ignore the characters unless attacked.</p><p>If both the rider and its mount are destroyed, this encounter can’t occur again. The destruction of one skeleton doesn’t prevent future encounters with the other.</p><h4>Strahd Zombies</h4><blockquote><p>Not even the cloying fog can hide the stench of death that descends upon you. Something evil approaches, its footsteps betrayed by snapping twigs.</p></blockquote><p>If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from the Strahd zombies. These undead soldiers once served as guards in Castle Ravenloft. They fled the castle after Strahd became a vampire but couldn’t avoid their master’s wrath. They still wear bits of tattered livery, and they attack the living on sight.</p><h4>Swarms of Bats</h4><blockquote><p>The stillness of the night is shattered by the shriek of bats and the flapping of tiny black wings.</p></blockquote><p>These bats are the servants of Strahd. They attack the characters without provocation.</p><h4>Swarms of Ravens</h4><blockquote><p>Your presence in this dreary land has not gone unnoticed. A raven follows you for several minutes while keeping a respectful distance.</p></blockquote><p>The raven doesn’t caw or try to communicate with the characters. If they leave it alone, read:</p><blockquote><p>More ravens begin to take an interest in you. Before long, their numbers swell, and soon hundreds of them are watching you.</p></blockquote><p>The ravens fly away if attacked. If they are left alone, they watch over the party, remaining with the characters until they reach Castle Ravenloft or a settlement. If the characters have a random encounter with hostile creatures, the raven swarms aid the characters by attacking and distracting their enemies.</p><h4>Trinket</h4><blockquote><p>You find something on the ground.</p></blockquote><p>A random character finds a lost trinket. Roll on the Trinkets table in appendix A, select a specific trinket from the table, or create one on the fly.</p><h4>Vistani Bandits</h4><blockquote><p>You catch a whiff of pipe smoke in the cold air and hear laughter through the fog.</p></blockquote><p>These Vistani servants of Strahd march through the Barovian wilderness, laughing and telling ghost stories. They are searching for graves to plunder or hunting small game. For a price of 100 gp, they offer to serve as guides. As long as these Vistani are with the party, roll a d12 instead of a d12 + d8 when determining random encounters in the wilderness. In addition, wolves and dire wolves don’t threaten the characters as long as the Vistani are traveling with them and aren’t their prisoners.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> One Vistani bandit carries a pouch that holds 2d4 small gemstones (worth 50 gp each).</p><h4>Wereraven</h4><p>This wereraven in raven form watches the characters from a distance. Compare its Dexterity (Stealth) check result to the characters’ passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to see whether it remains hidden from the party.</p><p>If one or more characters spot the creature, read:</p><blockquote><p>Through the mist, you see a black bird circling overhead. When it feels your eyes upon it, the raven flies away, but it’s back before long, keeping its distance.</p></blockquote><p>The wereraven belongs to a secret order called the Keepers of the Feather. If the characters don’t spot it, the wereraven shadows them for 1d4 hours. At the end of that time, or anytime sooner if the characters attack it, the creature flies home to report what it has seen.</p><p>If the party has a second random encounter with a wereraven, this one presents itself to the characters as an ally and requests that they travel to the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki to meet “some new friends.” It then flies off in the direction of the town.</p><h4>Werewolves</h4><p>If the werewolves are in human form, read:</p><blockquote><p>A deep voice calls out, “Who goes there?” Through the chill mist you see a large man in drab clothing wearing a tattered gray cloak. He has shaggy, black hair and thick muttonchops. He leans heavily on a spear and has a small bundle of animal pelts slung over his shoulder.</p></blockquote><p>If the werewolves are in wolf form, read:</p><blockquote><p>You hear the howl of a wolf some distance away.</p></blockquote><p>How the werewolves act depends on the form they have taken.</p><p><em><strong>Human Form.</strong></em> Werewolves in human form pretend to be trappers. If more than one is present, the others are within whistling distance.</p><p>They try to befriend the characters to see if they are carrying silvered weapons. If the characters appear to have no such weapons, the werewolves assume hybrid form and attack. Otherwise, they part company with the characters and leave well enough alone.</p><p><em><strong>Wolf Form.</strong></em> Werewolves in wolf form follow the party from a safe distance for several hours. If their Dexterity (Stealth) checks exceed the characters’ passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, the werewolves attack with surprise when the characters decide to take a short or long rest. Otherwise, they wait until the characters are weakened by another random encounter before moving in for the easy kill.</p><p>The werewolves’ lair is a cave complex that overlooks Lake Baratok (area Z). If you used the “Werewolves in the Mist” adventure hook to lure the characters to Barovia, captured werewolves can be forced to divulge the location of their den, where they keep their prisoners.</p><h4>Will-o’-Wisp</h4><p>This random encounter occurs only once. If it comes up again, treat the result as no encounter.</p><blockquote><p>Several hundred yards away, through the fog, you see a flickering torchlight.</p></blockquote><p>If the characters follow the flickering light, read:</p><blockquote><p>The torchlight flutters as it moves away from you, but you never lose sight of it. You make your way quickly yet cautiously through the fog until you come upon the shell of a ruined tower. The upper floors of the structure have collapsed, leaving heaps of rubble and shattered timber around the tower’s base. The feeble light moves through an open doorway on the ground floor, then flickers and goes out.</p></blockquote><p>The light is a will-o’-wisp that enters the ruined tower and becomes invisible, hoping to lure the characters inside to their doom.</p><p>The floor of the tower is made of packed earth. Its interior is desecrated ground (see “Wilderness Hazards” in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Against the inside wall of the tower, across from the open doorway, is a closed, empty wooden chest.</p><p>If the characters disturb the chest, 3d6 zombies erupt from the earthen floor and attack. Once the zombies appear, the will-o’-wisp becomes visible and joins the fray.</p><h4>Wolves</h4><blockquote><p>This land is home to many wolves, their howls at the moment too close for comfort.</p></blockquote><p>Characters have a few minutes to steel themselves before these wolves attack. They heed the will of Strahd and can’t be charmed or frightened.</p><h4>Zombies</h4><blockquote><p>The ungodly stench of rotting flesh hangs in the air. Up ahead, the walking, moaning corpses of dead men and women lumber about.</p></blockquote><p>These unfortunate Barovians fell prey to the evils of the land and now shamble from place to place as a ravenous mob.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"7092a829c3125381fd8959f7f72f520a2d8983e8","sourceId":"JournalEntry.XrZpvPNirJ6ctqxB"},"cf":{"id":"temp_yr0crbxvuec","path":"Curse of Strahd","color":"#98020a"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672446728092,"modifiedTime":1677352298987,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"XrZpvPNirJ6ctqxB","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

The gnome, Zimwald, speculated that Art may have served a wizard during the Last War, as Art demonstrated innate knowledge of a few simple works of magic.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Zimwald delivered Art to the University of Morgrave. Art was the subject of some study there, with his consent of course, and was rewarded with free tuition.

It was during this time, associating with the peoples of the lower levels of Sharn, that his name got corrupted from \"Art The Thinker\" to \"Art Tinker\", so named because of his habit of tapping on bits of metal trying to make things in his spare time.

I still lust for life and youth, and I curse the living that took them from me. … </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the words hang heavy in the air, Strahd’s voice somehow merging with the reader’s, you are unsurprised when the world seems to fall away and blackness surrounds you. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The weeks following Tatyana’s death and my transformation were chaotic and blurry. I feasted more freely then, not caring whose blood I spilled. I had hunted down the fools who had killed me and made them suffer, though they serve me still. Their screams were nothing to the howling despair of my heart, their spears and arrows nothing to the grief that pierced my soul. Heedless of pain and cries for mercy, I butchered each traitor to the last, meting justice as a lord should—for they dared to live while she did not. It was justice, not madness, that drove me, for not even in death could they escape my service. Believe me when I say that my servants would stock my larders for years to come. </p>\n<p>All except the traitor Leo Dilisnya, whose arrow pierced my heart. The bastard was one of my captains who thought to use the chaos to usurp me. He did not die slowly, nor will he ever rise from the dead, as allies of mine keep his bones even to this day.</p>\n<p>Many of the people quickly grew to fear the very worst, as the sun would no longer shine in my lands. The crops began to wither and die, and there came many envoys to Ravenloft to ask what I would do about the situation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Strahd commands undead soldiers around his castle as he stomps furiously through its halls. There is blood on his shirt, having clearly fed and not cared enough to clean afterward. He throws up the doors to the courtyard and catches himself, calmly walking out to greet those gathered. He stomps about 30 feet from the few well dressed envoys and simply raises an eyebrow. You watch them fall over themselves, trying to beg for aid and forgiveness from their lord and master as their world has come crashing down. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I told the locals that they must find a way to survive the coming famine that would surely follow. They pleaded with me to ask forgiveness of whatever god I had angered, they begged me to undo the spells I had cast upon the lands, they groveled, asking if nothing else to be let free from this place. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strahd’s expression changes slightly, unease and worry crossing his expression before he steels it and sneers at those gathered and shoos them away. He turns to leave and one of the envoys grabs at his shirt. Without warning, he grabs them by the throat in a blur and quickly lifts them up and drinks deeply from their throat. The others watch in horror before fleeing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had not expected that the mists would not allow anyone to leave, but upon reflection it did not surprise me overly much. I was the land itself, I had made my deals. That my influence stretched to edges of the land and the mists kept everyone in and all others out made a certain amount of sense. What I had not expected was that my show of impatience and power would inspire others to challenge me. One woman in particular, a priestess of the Morninglord named Markovia, had always walked a fine line of implying that I was a poison upon the land and that my rule should not go unchallenged. My new demeanor was all it took for her to raise an open rebellion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strahd is in what appears to be a dining room, hundreds of books lining the long table, most open and pages of notes all over. He is muttering arcane phrases to himself and seems to be searching for something magical. As he works, a shaking human enters, holding a missive. The servant gulps before clearing their throat and handing the parchment to Strahd. He glances up, clearly annoyed, but schooling his features and reads before crumpling the letter and ordering the servant out. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Following her declaration of open war against me, offering shelter to all those who would oppose me, I knew I could not let this stand. I gathered some of my new undead soldiers as well as several new spawn I had created and ordered them to go to this priestess’s church in Krezk and to kill every last one of them. I did not realize how foolish such a move was. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The scene shifts and you are in a small field, the forest on one side and a stone monastery on the other. You watch as many undead rush out from the forest at night, and a small gathered force meets them in the field. One of the figure’s blades continually lights up with holy light. You see flashes of silver and realize that the whole of Markovia’s forces are using silvered weapons or ones blessed by faith. It is a slaughter and not a single of the priestess’s forces fall as they destroy every last undead. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had underestimated young Markovia, thinking her to simply be a rabblerouser and voice for the unhappy. In truth she was a gifted paladin, blessed by the Morninglord himself. As the news of my forces’ defeat grew, Many more joined the paladin’s numbers. Sensing the strength and numbers she now had, she marched on Ravenloft, calling for my destruction. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The small army, numbering almost 100 strong, marches on Ravenloft and begins battling the undead that Strahd sends out. A small number breaks away and rushes to infiltrate the castle, including Markovia, several dusk elves and a dwarf. Suddenly you are in the castle, standing by a window, watching the group enter the courtyard. You see Strahd standing there, suddenly smiling.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea of these fools coming to challenge me, as if I were unprepared and had not laid my entire castle with traps for such an occasion, it lit some small flame within me. I was eager to test my mettle against theirs, to see how they would fare. I could suddenly imagine this as a true pastime. Nonetheless, I had underestimated Markovia once, and I would not do so again. I separated the fools from the priestess. I will admit to toying with them some before destroying them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You have quick visions of Strahd luring the elves into a different pathway and confusing them into attacking each other before coming in and striking them down himself, turning them into his spawn. Some of the humans with them suffer the same fate before you watch Markovia and the dwarf exploring by themselves. They fight side by side where possible. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soon it was clear I would have to face Markovia myself. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Markovia chases after Strahd while the dwarf is fighting against more undead. She turns back, about to help him when the dwarf calls out for her to keep going and to destroy the monster for all their sakes. Markovia sheds a tear and nods as she runs after Strahd towards one of the towers. The dwarf fights valiantly but is eventually struck down by the undead he is holding off. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Were I not the land, had I not taken precautions after Argynvost, I will admit that Markovia might have bested me. Truly she was the one who came closest. I still bear the scars from her onslaught, and this limp might never leave me. Still, in the end I was victorious. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd walk into the courtyard, limping, to face the gathered army. He says nothing, but throws the bloody shield that Markovia had wielded towards them, it being greatly dented and misshapen. He says nothing else, but turns his back on the horrified onlookers, returning to his castle. The army quickly disperses, a fear settling into their bones that they can’t shake. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No one tried to raise another army after that. The famine came and a great many died, but eventually the farmers discovered what would grow and life went onward. Sometimes I recall the saint who crossed blades with me. She mentioned that she had dreams of a better life, dreams of a Barovia free from me, dreams of freedom for her family. Most days I do not let myself get distracted by such things. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The vision once more fades to darkness as you hear your companion reading the final translated words aloud, Strahd’s voice and theirs merging.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dreams are for the living.</p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"G6PhBaTeHrU6tODw","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672519521385,"modifiedTime":1672519521385,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"bO4kYXDhtiEtnaNg","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

It was not a challenge, it was not a fight. In truth it was a slaughter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd’s army making short work of the unorganized bandits and razing their tents and structures to the ground. Strahd does little to control his armies until they reach the actual villages, where-in he reigns them in, clearly not wishing his lands to be damaged. You watch as he marches his armies up to the castle that you know to be Ravenloft, where he performs an ancient rite. He cuts his wrist and bleeds onto the ground in the cardinal directions. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I did the sacred rites that bound me as the ruler to this land, rites that the Dusk Elves had defiled when they chased my family from our ancestral lands. Even had I wished to take the land back, they had ensured that it would not tie to me or my kin again. Still, this new land, land that had once belonged to the Elves, was sufficient.  I thought my campaign over, and consulted with my advisors about how best to transition the authority and loyalty of the towns and villages to me. Even I was surprised when the attacks began.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as more of the bandits, this time organized and well fed begin to attack Strahd’s men as they try to patrol the areas of the valley. Strahd’s soldiers, tired and weakened do not fare well against these attacks.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It took me quite some time to discover a mansion west of Luna River and North of Berez that had apparently been sheltering my enemies. The group that lived there had declared me an enemy to all people and had sworn to see me purged from the valley, no matter the cost. They aided butchers and bandits, helped those who had fed off of the land. And so I directed some of my troops to engage them, to test this strange Order. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strahd’s soldiers approach a gorgeous mansion but are driven off and defeated to a man by knights wearing silver plate-mail. The knights fight well and organized, and seem to be well trained. They do not spare any of Strahd’s men, but nor do they let them linger. All are given swift deaths and their bodies collected and brought to mass graves. You see a scout watching from a distance takes note of all of this before disappearing into the treeline. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More than simply trying my patience, this Order seemed to take particular caution to kill any of my men who ventured too far South while trying to map out the region. I kept sending small battalions to test the Order’s strength and to keep them off guard. All the while I kept the bulk of my forces close by and let them heal and rest. While the Order claimed many small victories, I ensured they did not have the time nor the ability to rest. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as the knights continue to be victorious, only occasionally loosing one of their number. However, as you watch them continue to beat back Strahd’s forces, you notice that their numbers to not replenish. You begin to recognize the same knights again and again.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As the winter drew to a close, my reinforcements arrived, and as they came to the valley, I gathered the rest of my men and stormed the mansion. As I rode out in front, I watched the knights come out to meet my men, nearly a thousand trained soldiers under competent generals, and watched as their mere numbers, less than a hundred, marched to meet us. I was looking at dead men. Before another hour passed, I’d send them wailing on their way to a rotting hell. All of them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The fight is bloody and not as one sided as Strahd first believed. As the knights try to stand against the soldiers, you watch as there is a monumental roar that shakes the very ground. Even Strahd looks up, worried. Without warning a great silver dragon comes out from the sky above the mansion and begins to decimate part of the army. Strahd curses and quickly begins to reorganize. He has his men focus on the dragon while keeping the knights at bay. </p>\n<p>Strahd’s men pierce the dragon with hundreds of arrows, quickly shredding their wings and forcing them to the ground. Strahd rides up and leads his men into battle, ordering those with lances to rush up and stab at the dragon before rushing backward. Despite all its effort, the dragon is quickly brought close to death. Strahd strides up and with a wild scream plunges his sword through the creature’s head. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though I had not expected the Order to be led by a Dragon, we were victorious none-the-less. The rest of the Order could not stand long against the tide of my men, especially after seeing their great leader felled. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The knights quickly fall under the blades of Strahd’s army and the bloody soldier all scream in victory. You watch as Strahd considers the dragon quickly before order his men to chop up the body and scatter its bones. He marches his men into the mansion which many of them begin to ransack, but Strahd takes little notice. He strides to one of the main rooms and finds a library, containing a multitude of books. Strahd walks up to one and examines it closely, seeing how it contains arcane knowledge and he smiles to himself as he takes the book with him. He barks orders for the rest of the library to be boxed up and brought to Ravenloft, threatening that all the tomes had best make it undamaged. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As I made my way back to Ravenloft, I was on top of the world. I had discovered a horde of magical learning, and slain a dragon, all in one afternoon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The vision fades to darkness as you hear your companion reading the final translated words aloud, Strahd’s voice and theirs merging.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had no way of knowing then that this would only be the beginning of my troubles with the Order of the Silver Dragon.</p>\n</blockquote>"},"_id":"gukVs09ITQXagPSI","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672519521223,"modifiedTime":1672519521223,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"iMif0iHSFCzIjyv3","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

It was at the age that this 12 year old half elven child stumbled into the village of Magh Meall, no knowledge of where he came from or what had happened to him. Found collapsed in the golden fields of grain that encircled Magh Meall, Caolán was found by priests and nursed back to health for over a month at the shrine, where the inhabitants of Magh Meall honour the Tuatha Dé Danann. While outsiders are permitted to enter the domain for purposes such as trade and travel, permanent residence is scarcely given, however Caolán was permitted to stay as there was little knowledge of the boys origin.</p>\n<p>Without an orphanage present within the village, Caolán was taken in by the Ó Dálaigh  family upon his recovery, Ferghus and Dilys Ó Dálaigh . Ferghus Ó Dálaigh , while regarded as a rather poor smith is an extremely hard and passionate worker, working together with his wife Dilys, an extremely skilled tailor talented enough to make up for Ferghus's lack of income and a temper sharp enough to keep him on task, together the duo run a halfway decent shop in Magh Meall. The Ó Dálaigh  were more than happy to take in the young half-elf do their inability to have children of their own, and for the next 8 years would watch over him. </p>\n<p>Caolán found it difficult to interact with the other denizens of the village, it was not that they acted in anyway rude towards the boy, in fact the majority of the village quickly accepted him. This difficulty not only came from his lack of knowledge in how to properly interact with people, but was also partially due to Caolán's personality of cool indifference and muted emotions, this made it awkward for him to interact with others as he was often brutally honest/no filter and had trouble conveying his thoughts. There were however two people that befriended the young half elf, Tadhg Ó Duinn and Roisin Sheehan, a pair of children a year older than Caolán, who took him under their wing. In Magh Meall, upon reaching the age of 20, during the Lughnasadh festival (harvest), young adults may choose to undergo the Ceremony of the Dagda's Trials to earn the favour of the gods. Those who succeed leave Magh Meall as adventuring emissaries with the goal of earning a place beside the Tuatha Dé Danann in death when they pass into Tír na nÓg. Tadhg and Roisin are two such individuals, spurred on by the stories of great hero's such as Lugh, Cú Chulainn, and Scáthach, the two young human had already been training for years by this point and were well on their way to being prepared for their ceremonies. Not wanting to be left behind Caolán began training with them, however years behind already, the immense gap in skill would be difficult to close. </p>\n<p>For the next 7 years, Caolán, when not helping his foster parents in their work, devoted as much of his time as he could to catching up with his friends in the hopes of succeeding in the ceremony and joining them. It was during this time that Caolán had begun to study the faith of the Tuatha Dé Danann, becoming infatuated by their stories and exploits.</p>\n<p>Tadhg and Roisin passed their ceremony easily, gaining the favour of the gods, preparing to leave the village with the plan being that I would meet up with if I passed my ceremony coming the next year. If was not long after their departure that Caolán's all to common nightmares began to morph into something new, hes walking through a dark forest covered in blood, except that these where not the forests of Elysium, these woods were much darker and felt, much worse, and then he comes upon them, the bloodied corpses of Tadhg and Roisin. These dreams felt so real, often waking up Caolán in the night with a sick inescapable feeling in his stomach, motivating Caolán to work even harder.</p>\n<p>Even now with years of study, Caolán found himself lacking compared to his companions, the possibility of failure sitting painfully in the back of his mind. With only a year left, Caolán had to find a way to drastically improve his combat skills, to do so he would have to seek help from someone who had passed the test previously, Scáthach. Scáthach, know as \"the shadow\", lived apart from the rest of Magh Meall on an island known as Cuillin across the river Oceanus but still within the domain. Previously the Tadhg and Roisin had approached the hero asking her to train them and they were denied. Scáthach found the constantly positive outlook of the other villagers tiring, years of adventuring, fighting, and the lost of her party mates had forged a stubbornly cynical personality, so maybe it was because Caolán did not share that same happy attitude that the other had, or perhaps Scáthach was simply bored and found the thought of training the young half-elf amusing. For the next year Scáthach taught Caolán how to fight with short sword and scabbard, the only weapons suitable for his small frame and build, and how to weave magic into his techniques. However the most useful lessons Scáthach gave Caolán, were those that she had learned on her journey, that the world is a brutal place full of monsters and painful. The training was brutal far more so than anything the trio had done together in preparation, so much so that Caolán fell unconscious for days at a time due to the strain. It was during these times of unconsciousness that a new confusing dream had begun to haunt Caolán's sleep, these weren't the horrible dreams of his past or those of his dead friends (much to his relief), he saw only the faintly visible face of an old women and a location, and a town Scáthach told me to be Phandalin.</p>\n<p>This year of intense work had managed to pay off, when the Lughnasadh festival came in his 20th year, and after the festivities celebrating the plentiful harvest , Caolán was permitted to participate in the ceremony along with two other young adults. The Ceremony of the Dagda's Trials tests the abilities of the participants by placing them in a trance/dreaming state, where they are put through various situations requiring all of their capabilities to complete. The trials requiring a knowledge of various subjects or problem solving skills were a breeze for Caolán, however even with the harsh training given to him by Scáthach, he barely succeeded in the combat trials. Upon awakening (hours after the trial had ended) he discovered he passed only by the skin of his teeth, neither the other two participants had succeeded at all. Given a steel necklace of the interlocking holy symbols of the members of the Tuatha Dé Danann given to all who pass the trials as mark the gods favour.</p>\n<p>Now with the permission of the Tuatha Dé Danann, Caolán was ready to leave Magh Meall to adventure as an emissary of the gods. While one would normally feel excited, Caolán felt uneasy, the thoughts of his dreams; his friends bloodied and dying beneath him, and the visage of strange woman, haunting his thoughts. It is to be his first task to find if there was any truth within these dreams, and to do that he must follow the only lead they had given him, the town of Phandalin situated on material plane. Before his departure, his foster parents gifted him with equipment, his mother Dilys gave to him armour of studded leather and beautifully crafted wizards coat of brown cloth with accents of tartan, adorned with brass symbols of our faith such as the triskele and trinity knot. His father, known far and wide for his poor craftsmanship forged for Caolán a short sword, a sword that looked as if it stayed together only by the grace of Brigid the Smith god. As Caolán left Magh Meall for the first time since his arrival 8 years ago, his instructor came to see him off and scold him for his poor performance in the combat trials, jokingly (hopefully) giving him 3:1 odds of surviving for more than a year, against.</p>\n<p>And with that Caolán set off for Phandalin</p>\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"puIICcFcflcsi8te","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672685770255,"modifiedTime":1672685770255,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"iQgtjT9q8wjlMbop","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

Neferon will reject any tribute that does not meet his standards, and will allow its offerer to provide a new tribute.</p><p>A <em><strong>tribute of knowledge</strong></em> must be a useful and well-hidden secret about some part of Barovia. Neferon is not interested in information that is either widely known, such as the existence of Van Richten's Tower; information regarding current events, such as the death of Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich; or secrets with little value or impact, such as the nature of Stella Wachter's madness.</p><p>Potential tributes include:</p><ul><li>The true lycanthropic nature of the Keepers of the Feather</li><li>The headquarters and leadership of the Keepers of the Feather</li><li>The identity and location of Mordenkainen</li><li>The contents of the Tome of Strahd</li><li>The true identity of the Abbot</li><li>The history and current status of the Fanes of Barovia</li></ul><p>A <em><strong>tribute of power</strong></em> must be a magic item of rare or greater value. A sacrifice of three or more uncommon magic items will also meet Neferon's approval. Alternatively, a character can offer three amber shards to gain passage to the interior of the Amber Temple. These tributes can be placed at the base of area X5a by the character that offers it.</p><p>Upon accepting the tributes of all who wish to enter into the Temple, Neferon offers the following promise and warning:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You shall have safe passage to and from the Temple, so long as you take no treasure that is not freely given. Be warned - I and my guardians are not the only inhabitants of this place, and those that dwell deeper within may greet you with hostility or violence. Your safety is your sole responsibility. And remember - those that break the accords of this Temple shall be condemned to haunt it forevermore.</p></aside><p>Once the tributes have been made, if any creature attempts to enter the Temple without Neferon's permission (e.g., while invisible), or if the PCs attempt to enter the Temple via areas such as @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x5.-temple-of-lost-secrets]{X5}, @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x6.-southeast-annex]{X6} or @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x15.-southwest-annex]{X15} without making a sufficient offering, Neferon and the three flameskulls in area @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x17.-upper-west-hall]{X17} immediately attack.</p><p>For as long as the PCs remain in the temple, Neferon will follow invisibly, taking care to keep at least 30 feet from the party and, wherever possible, hovering 20 feet above the ground at all times. He will employ his at-will invisibility spell and his Teleport action to avoid the PCs while monitoring them closely for any evidence of thievery.</p><p>For every 30 minutes that the PCs remain in the temple, Neferon must make a <strong>Dexterity</strong> (Stealth) check; if the passive <strong>Wisdom</strong> (Perception) of the PC or NPC closest to him exceeds his result, that character can hear the sound of whooshing air behind and above the party, as though a strange breeze is moving through the air.

The statue's stony hands are outstretched as if in the midst of casting a spell. Its face is a void of utter blackness. The ominous statue stands between two black marble balconies, one of which has partially collapsed and fallen on the temple's black marble floor, in front of an open doorway. The walls of the temple are sheathed in amber, and the doors leading from it are made of amber as well. Arched hallways coated with amber lead away from the temple to the west and east. Flanking these exits are alcoves that hold white marble statues of robed human wizards with pointed hats and golden staffs.

Creatures behind the arrow slits gain three-quarters cover.</p><p>The marble wizard statues stand 8 feet tall. Their 9-foot-tall golden staffs are made of wrought iron coated in peeling gold paint. The northeast statue fell over when an earth tremor collapsed the wall of its alcove.</p><h3>X5a. God of Secrets</h3><p>This 40-foot-tall statue, carved out of granite, depicts a faceless god of secrets.

They needed a vault in which to contain the evil vestiges (remnants of dead, malevolent entities) they had captured and the hoard of forbidden knowledge they had amassed. They dedicated the temple to a god of secrets, whom they trusted to keep it hidden from the rest of the world until the end of time. Unfortunately for the wizards, even the will of a god couldn't prevent other evil creatures from learning the temple's location. The wizards were forced to guard the temple themselves, to keep its secrets from falling into villainous hands. The evil forces that were imprisoned within the temple eventually corrupted the wizards, turning them against one another.</p><p>The wizards were dead and gone by the time an evil archmage named Exethanter arrived at the temple. He breached the temple's wards, spoke to a vestige trapped in amber, and discovered the secret to becoming a lich. After his transformation, the lich Exethanter took over the temple and turned the skulls of it previous defenders into flameskulls under his command. Exethanter then took it upon himself to watch over the temple, not to hoard its evil secrets but to share them openly.

The evil powers in the temple felt something much stronger: a darkness that eclipsed their own. Strahd communed with these evil vestiges and forged a pact with them. When Strahd later murdered his brother Sergei, that pact was sealed with blood. Strahd transformed into a vampire, and the Dark Powers turned his land into a prison.</p><p>Strahd has returned to the temple several times to learn new magic and to find a means of escaping his fate, but the Dark Powers have no intention of giving him up. These recent years have been difficult for Exethanter, whose body and mind have been falling apart. The lich has grown weak and forgetful. He no longer remembers his name or his spells. He knows only that the Dark Powers that created Strahd's domain were born in the temple, and that these entities feed on the evil that Strahd represents.

The dusk elf comes to the temple on occasion to petition the dark god into releasing his master from his torment.</p><p>Rahadin rides a phantom steed along Tsolenka Pass to the Amber Temple and kneels before the great statue in area X5. (The arcanaloth that guards the temple knows Rahadin and doesn't harm him. The arcanaloth and the flameskulls don't attack other visitors until Rahadin is killed or leaves.) Rahadin then pulls out a live toad, swallows it whole as a sacrifice, and offers a gesture of supplication to the secret god.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>Rahadin knows that Strahd will deal with the characters when he sees fit. If the characters confront the dusk elf, he defends himself but won't cause them any permanent harm. Strahd's chamberlain would sooner die than allow himself to be captured. Rahadin doesn't divulge his reason for visiting the temple, or even who is he or what role he serves. Left to his own devices, he rides back to Castle Ravenloft.</p><h3>Kasimir's Dark Gift</h3><p>If Kasimir Velikov (see appendix D and chapter 5, area N9a) finds his way to area X42 and accepts the dark gift of Zhudun, he then asks the characters to accompany him to the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft so that he can restore the life of his centuries-dead sister, Patrina Velikovna (see chapter 4, area K84, crypt 21).</p><h4>Development</h4><p>If Kasimir succeeds in his quest, the newly resurrected Patrina (NE female dusk elf archmage) feigns repentance until she regains her strength and her spells, whereupon she travels to Castle Ravenloft and attempts to return to Strahd, seeking to become his vampire bride at last.

Through much trial and error, he was able to develop a specific recipe capable of doing so, but with one problem: to instill the necessary divine energy, it required an infusion of holy water, an ingredient that Exethentar is wholly incapable of producing. </p><p><em><strong>The Alchemist's Almanac</strong></em> is currently opened to the last page, where a @JournalEntry[6EKftf4mJOEaQ5g7]{scribbled recipe} (for a Potion of Greater Restoration) is jotted on the final page.  The remainder of the Almanac is a catalogue of known ingredients.</p><h4>Brew Greater Restoration</h4><p>In the event that the PCs are unable to cast greater restoration to restore Exethanter's memories, the party can instead attempt to brew the recipe listed in it's spellbook.

A DC 15 <strong>Arcana </strong>check can identify the correct potion ingredients in Exethantor's cupboard to serve third-degree reagents, including an activator and a declinator, which must be added in the appropriate proportions. Alternatively, the PCs can locate the proper ingredients by searching through <em>The Alchemist's Almanac</em>.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Within Exethanter's ingredients cupboard lies a pair of glass bottles that appear to contain the leaves of distinct plants. The bottles are unmarked. One contains a number of thick, curled leaves with an indigo coloration; the other contains a half-dozen needle-thin leaves with a razor-sharp edge. A successful DC 17 <strong>Nature</strong> check can identify that the curled leaves are poisonous BLACKWORT and the needle leaves are NIGHTFERN leaves. </p><p>If the bottle containing the poisonous blackwort is opened, it immediately emits a cloud of toxic gas, forcing each creature within a ten-foot radius to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 points of poison damage, or half on a success.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>. In the northwest corner of Exethanter's lair, within the wall close to the ceiling, rests a hidden compartment no larger than a fist. It can be located with a successful DC 15 <strong>Intelligence</strong> (Investigation) check or one hour of careful searching; if the check result was 20 or higher, the PCs also locate a poisonous needle trap concealed within the compartment's door mechanism.</p><p>The needle trap can be disarmed with a successful DC 20 <strong>Thieves' Tools</strong> check. If the compartment is opened without first disarming the trap, the opener must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, suffering 10d6 poison damage on a failure or half on a success. This compartment contains a small glass vial containing a brilliant cerulean blue liquid marked “RIMESAP.”</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Beside the cauldron rests a glass vial labelled “WYVERN MUCUS.” Though its contents are empty, a thick film of dried-up grey-colored flakes cling to the sides. A successful DC 16 <strong>Wisdom</strong> (Medicine) check can match the dried-up remnants of this ingredient with a trio of other vials of grey-white liquid within Exethanter's component cupboard. </p><p>A trio of vials containing a similar liquid are mixed in with the others; these contain concentrated <em>Pale Tincture</em>. A creature that ingests even a small amount of Pale Tincture must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every hour, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save. This damage cannot be healed by any means, though the poison can be removed from the creature's system by means of lay on hands or similar magic. After seven successful Saving Throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>. The potion can only be completed if holy water is added. The PCs may obtain holy water from Ezmerelda (if she is travelling with the party and still has some available), from the ceremony spell, or by some other means.</p></aside><h2>X28.

Secret Room</h2><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dust and cobwebs fill this otherwise empty room.</p></aside><p>The ceiling here is 10 feet high.</p><h2>X30. Preserved Library</h2><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This stone library has twenty-foot-high walls and a thirty-foot-high vaulted ceiling. Covering the ceiling is a fresco that depicts angels being set ablaze in a hell. A black marble railing encloses a gold marble staircase that spirals gently down a thirty-foot-wide, thirty-foot-deep shaft to the north. Against the gray walls stand six ten-foot-tall, black marble bookcases. On their shelves are hundreds of well-preserved tomes. Embroidered rugs, chairs, and lit candelabras fill the southern half of the room.</p></aside><p>The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x42.-amber-vault]{X42}. Peering over the railing reveals crates in that area.</p><p>There are no ladders here to reach the high bookshelves. (The wizards who built this place used mage hand spells.) All the books appear to have blank covers and empty pages. Holding a book while speaking its secret command word causes the book's text to magically appear. Only @UUID[Actor.pMEAVfKnnZQAZDS6]{Exethanter} knows the command word for each book, and only if its memory is restored. A true seeing spell also allows one to see the magically obfuscated text. The tomes mostly contain vile, forbidden lore. Many spellbooks are hidden here, collectively holding every wizard spell in the Player's Handbook.</p><p>A book that is taken from the library disintegrates as the magic that preserves it is dispelled. The room's furnishings, which are also magically preserved, deteriorate and become brittle if taken from the room.</p><p>The secret door in the center of the west wall can be pulled open to reveal an empty room (area @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x29.-secret-room]{X29}). The one in the center of the south wall can be pulled open to reveal a staircase that descends 30 feet to another secret door leading to area @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x5.-temple-of-lost-secrets]{X5}.</p><h4>Entry</h4><p>Upon entering this chamber, the PCs can find <strong>Exethanter</strong> standing on the carpet in the center of the room, looking lost.</p><p>Exethanter has fewer hit points than normal (101hit points), doesn't remember its name, and has forgotten all of its prepared spells. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">It does know its cantrips.</span></span></p><p>After greeting them, <em>if the PCs seem friendly</em>, the lich asks if any of the characters have seen his “book.” If asked, he describes the book as “heavy” and “wrapped in a smooth, tough material” (leather). He also recalls that it has the word “Incants” in the title, and that he left it open on a desk somewhere. He doesn't know where the desk is, but knows that it isn't downstairs.</p><p>If the PCs are still being invisibly tailed by @Actor[jdU4yOB8AB1RyaSX]{Neferon}, the arcanaloth, after making the tribute at the Temple entrance, Exethanter notices its presence using his truesight several minutes after first encountering the PCs. Though he doesn't recognize Neferon due to his memory loss, Exethanter points out the appearance of a strange, fox-faced creature in the air toward the top of the chamber, and asks the PCs if it's a friend of theirs. Upon hearing this, Neferon swiftly retreats from sight.</p><h4>Exethanter</h4><p>In its current condition, the lich has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP). A greater restoration spell restores the lich's memory and all of its spells. Another casting of the spell restores its normal hit point maximum.</p><p>If the characters restore its memory (1st casting of Greater Restoration), the lich gives them the passwords to all the locked doors in the Amber Temple (with the exception of the door into area @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x28.-hidden-phylactery]{X28}).</p><p>It also provides all the information pertaining to Strahd and the temple presented at the start of this chapter (see the @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR]{introduction}). If the characters think to ask, it provides them with the command words for any of the books in this library.</p><p>If the characters restore its body (2nd casting of Greater Restoration), it offers to escort them while they explore the temple. The other creatures that inhabit the temple don't threaten the characters as long as the lich is with them.</p><p>The lich defends itself if attacked and turns to dust if it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><h2>X31. Central Catacombs</h2><p>These catacombs contain the moldy remains of the wizards who once defended the Amber Temple. Later generations of wizards who were corrupted by the evil of the temple smashed the amber sheaths covering the dead wizards' bodies and stole everything of value, leaving the formerly preserved corpses to rot.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You smell the horrid perfume of the ancient dead. Stone niches along the walls of these catacombs hold human-shaped amber husks, bones, and tattered shrouds.</p></aside><p>If the characters enter these catacombs, add:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Tall, iron candlesticks stand in alcoves. Their candles ignite as you enter, casting flickering light upon the walls and causing the shattered amber to glitter.</p></aside><p>The magic candles ignite when a living creature enters the catacombs and melt away if taken from the area.</p><h3>X31a. West Catacombs</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>More skeletal remains fill niches in the walls of this smaller annex, the amber husks that once preserved them smashed beyond repair.</p></aside><p>This is where all of the real amber husks are that belonged to wizards of ages past.

When a husk is touched, it will crumble to dust.</p><p>Inside one of the husks is 10 gold pieces. While this is not a significant monetary reward, it puts players in the mindset that other husks might contain interesting items.</p><p>No wizards were entombed here. This annex is empty.</p><h2>X32. Lower East Hall</h2><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The walls and ceiling of this great hall are coated in amber that glistens like fresh honey. Dust covers the black marble floor. To the north, the hall has collapsed, leaving a wall of rubble.</p><p>Many amber doors lead from this hall. Standing in front of the south door are three ugly women in tattered black gowns with brooms and black, pointed hats.</p></aside><p>An earth tremor collapsed the northern part of the hall. Three @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.ymJCzy3JBLRT8IvH]{Barovian witches} are trying to open the amber door to area @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x33a.-vault-of-shalx]{X33a} by trying different passwords, unaware that they could gain entry through the shaft in area @UUID[.ueDanAmb3nSBcGWR#x6.-southeast-annex]{X6}. Frustrated by their lack of progress, they vent their rage by attacking the characters. The witches let loose their three @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.jX6QznWhlmLkY6LE]{brooms of animated attack} while they cast spells.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>If two of the witches are killed or incapacitated, the surviving witch attempts to escape by flying away on her broom. Only the witches can use the brooms of animated attack in this fashion.</p><h2>X33. Amber Vaults</h2><p>Several of these amber-glazed rooms are located along the periphery of the complex. Each room contains two or more amber sarcophagi (see the \"Amber Sarcophagi\" sidebar).</p><aside class=\"rules-text\"><p>AMBER SARCOPHAGI</p><p>An amber sarcophagus looks like a rough block of solid amber 8 feet tall, 5 feet wide, and 5 feet thick. Trapped inside the block is a sliver or wisp of utter darkness no more than a few inches long. The darkness is the vestige of a dead and hateful god—a shard of pure evil with shreds of sentience and awareness. The vestige can't be harmed or controlled, and it is immune to all conditions.</p><p>An amber sarcophagus has AC 16, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying one causes the vestige trapped within it to disappear, leaving no trace. You choose whether it is banished or destroyed.</p><p>A creature that touches the amber sarcophagus forms a telepathic link with the vestige inside. The vestige offers the creature a dark gift. The creature must willingly accept the gift to gain its benefits. A dark gift is described to the creature in general terms; its precise game effect isn't revealed until the creature accepts the gift. For example, a creature that touches Fekre's sarcophagus in area X33a is offered the power to spread disease. That the gift grants the ability to cast the contagion spell is not articulated.</p><p>A dark gift functions like a charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 7, “Treasure,” of the Dungeon Master's Guide). A creature doesn't receive a dark gift if it is being manipulated or coerced, or if it declines the gift. Once it receives a dark gift, a creature can never receive that same dark gift again.</p><p>The instant a dark gift is bestowed, the creature receiving it undergoes a transformation, gaining a sinister physical trait or flaw, or one of each. Unless the text states otherwise, a trait or a flaw that accompanies this gift can't be removed by anything short of a wish spell or divine intervention.</p><p>Each time a non-evil creature accepts a dark gift, it must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature's alignment changes to evil. A character who turns evil becomes an NPC under the Dungeon Master's control, although the DM can allow the player to continue playing the evil character.</p></aside><h3>X33a. Vault of Shalx</h3><p>The amber door to this room is sealed with an @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-9-spells.VWzDySjVyTe2mMxs]{arcane lock} spell. The password to suppress the spell is “Shalx.” A character can push open the doors with a successful DC 25 Strength check. The door (AC 15, 30 hit points) can also be smashed. If the door is reduced to 0 hit points, necrotic energy fills the 30-foot cube directly in front of it. A creature in the area takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage, turning to dust and bones if reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>Adjust the following text if the creatures in this room have already been encountered and destroyed.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This room has walls of glazed amber, a floor of red marble, and a rough-hewn shaft in the center of its ten-foot-high ceiling.

Although he can be encountered almost anywhere in his domain, the vampire is always encountered in the place indicated by the card reading later in this chapter, unless he has been forced into his tomb in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.</p><h3>The Vampire’s History</h3><p>In life, Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family’s enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic beauty that he decided to settle there.</p><p>Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him. Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality.</p><p>Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his love for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. Sergei eventually took up residence at Ravenloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother’s body in a crypt beneath the castle.</p><p>Strahd’s attention soon turned to Tatyana, a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished Tatyana with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd’s efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer Sergei. Strahd’s pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple’s love until the day of Sergei and Tatyana’s wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered Sergei and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased Sergei’s bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. Tatyana hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd’s pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows.</p><p>But Strahd did not die. The Dark Powers honored the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire.</p><p>After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of Barovia. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.</p><p>Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts—none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire’s game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren’t so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion.</p><p>Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the Dark Powers to release him.</p><aside class=\"epigraph-with--author\"><p>I am the Ancient. I am the Land.</p><p>My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I am not dead. Nor am I alive. I am undead, forever.</p><p>—Tome of Strahd</p></aside><h3>Strahd’s Goals</h3><p>Strahd has the following goals in the adventure.</p><h4>Turn Ireena Kolyana</h4><p>Strahd’s unrequited love for Tatyana drove him to slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman Ireena Kolyana in the village of Barovia and felt extreme déjà vu. Ireena looked exactly like Tatyana! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of Tatyana, and thus he seeks to claim her.</p><p>Strahd’s evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home—the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Barovia—and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort.</p><p>Chapter 3 gives details about Ireena and where to find her in the village of Barovia.</p><h4>Find Rudolph van Richten</h4><p>Although he is usually focused on making Ireena Kolyana his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten has come to Barovia. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching Barovia for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.</p><p>Chapter 5 describes the town of Vallaki, where van Richten currently resides incognito.</p><h4>Search for a Successor or Consort</h4><p>Strahd can sense the arrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter Barovia, he shifts his attention from Ireena Kolyana and van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn’t arrive at this conclusion immediately.)</p><p>Strahd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued—even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.</p><h3>Roleplaying Strahd</h3><p>Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn’t suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.</p><p>When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of Tatyana, but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn’t have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.</p><p>In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still—not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won’t yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd’s humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he’s preying on Ireena Kolyana, he tells them that Ireena’s body is the host for Tatyana’s soul, and Tatyana’s soul belongs to him.</p><p>Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a time—playthings to possess or discard as he desires.</p><p>If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn’t honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.</p><h3>When Strahd Attacks</h3><p>Strahd isn’t a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from it—he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading. His combat details are available in appendix D.</p><p>When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day. If they’re indoors, he tries to charm or goad a character into inviting him inside (along with his vampire spawn, if they are present). Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena.</p><p>These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Fortunes of Ravenloft","type":"text","_id":"MBOy8SOdnyCQrbn5","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The events of this adventure are part of dark twists of fate that a fortuneteller can discern with the cards of a tarokka deck.

Where children once cried, the treasure lies still.</p><p>The treasure is in the nursery of the Abbey of Saint Markovia (chapter 8, area S23).</p><p>3 of Coins—Trader</p><p>Look to the wizard of wines! In wood and sand the treasure hides.</p><p>The treasure lies in the glassblower’s workshop in the Wizard of Wines winery (chapter 12, area W10).</p><p>4 of Coins—Merchant</p><p>Seek a cask that once contained the finest wine, of which not a drop remains.</p><p>The treasure lies in Castle Ravenloft’s wine cellar (chapter 4, area K63).</p><p>5 of Coins—Guild Member</p><p>I see a dark room full of bottles. It is the tomb of a guild member.</p><p>The treasure lies in the crypt of Artank Swilovich (chapter 4, area K84, crypt 5).</p><p>6 of Coins—Beggar</p><p>A wounded elf has what you seek. He will part with the treasure to see his dark dreams fulfilled.</p><p>The treasure is hidden in Kasimir’s hovel (chapter 5, area N9a).</p><p>7 of Coins—Thief</p><p>What you seek lies at the crossroads of life and death, among the buried dead.</p><p>The treasure is buried in the graveyard at the River Ivlis crossroads (chapter 2, area F).</p><p>8 of Coins—Tax Collector</p><p>The Vistani have what you seek. A missing child holds the key to the treasure’s release.</p><p>The treasure is hidden in the Vistani treasure wagon (chapter 5, area N9i). “A missing child” refers to Arabelle (see chapter 2, area L).</p><p>9 of Coins—Miser</p><p>Look for a fortress inside a fortress, in a place hidden behind fire.</p><p>The treasure lies in Castle Ravenloft’s treasury (chapter 4, area K41).</p><p>Master of Coins—Rogue</p><p>I see a nest of ravens.

(Some cards offer two possible results, A and B; in such a case, you can pick the one you prefer or that better suits the circumstances of the adventure.)</p><p>Strahd senses that this NPC is a danger to him and tries to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible. This NPC, whoever it ends up being, gains the following additional action:</p><p>Inspire. While within sight of Strahd, this character grants inspiration to one player character he or she can see.</p><p>Each of the NPCs described in this section has a role to play in the adventure, even if that individual isn’t indicated in the card reading. For the one so designated, however, the information in this section regarding the NPC’s behavior takes precedence over whatever is said elsewhere in these pages; that NPC is extraordinary.</p><p>Artifact (Joker 1)</p><p>Look for an entertaining man with a monkey. This man is more than he seems.</p><p>This card refers to Rictavio (see appendix D), who can be found at the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki (chapter 5, area N2). Normally reluctant to accompany the characters, Rictavio changes his tune if the characters tell him about the card reading. He sheds his disguise and introduces himself as Dr. Rudolph van Richten.</p><p>The characters might think that Gadof Blinsky, the toymaker of Vallaki (area N7), is the figure they seek, because he has a pet monkey. If they speak to him about this possibility, Blinsky jokes that he and the monkey are “old friends,” but if the characters ask him to come with them to fight Strahd, he politely declines. If the characters tell him about the tarokka reading, Blinsky admits that he acquired the monkey from a half-elf carnival ringmaster named Rictavio.</p><p>Beast (Jack of Diamonds)</p><p>A werewolf holds a secret hatred for your enemy. Use her hatred to your advantage.</p><p>This card refers to the werewolf Zuleika Toranescu (see chapter 15, area Z7). She will accompany the characters if they promise to avenge her mate, Emil, by killing the leader of her pack, Kiril Stoyanovich.</p><p>A. Broken One (King of Diamonds)</p><p>Your greatest ally will be a wizard. His mind is broken, but his spells are strong.</p><p>This card refers to the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok (see chapter 2, area M).</p><p>B. Broken One (King of Diamonds)</p><p>I see a man of faith whose sanity hangs by a thread. He has lost someone close to him.</p><p>This card refers to Donavich, the priest in the village of Barovia (see chapter 3, area E5). He will not accompany the characters until his son, Doru, is dead and buried.</p><p>Darklord (King of Spades)</p><p>Ah, the worst of all truths: You must face the evil of this land alone!</p><p>There is no NPC who can inspire the characters.</p><p>A. Donjon (King of Clubs)</p><p>Search for a troubled young man surrounded by wealth and madness. His home is his prison.</p><p>This card refers to Victor Vallakovich (see chapter 5, area N3t). Realizing that the characters are the key to his salvation, he enthusiastically leaves home and accompanies them to Castle Ravenloft.</p><p>B. Donjon (King of Clubs)</p><p>Find a girl driven to insanity, locked in the heart of her dead father’s house. Curing her madness is key to your success.</p><p>This card refers to Stella Wachter (see chapter 5, area N4n). She grants the party no benefit unless her madness is cured. With her wits restored, Stella is happy to join the party and leave her rotten family behind.</p><p>Seer (Jack of Clubs)</p><p>Look for a dusk elf living among the Vistani. He has suffered a great loss and is haunted by dark dreams. Help him, and he will help you in return.</p><p>This card refers to Kasimir Velikov (see chapter 5, area N9a). The dusk elf accompanies the characters to Castle Ravenloft only after they lead him to the Amber Temple and help him find the means to resurrect his dead sister, Patrina Velikovna.</p><p>A. Ghost (King of Hearts)</p><p>I see a fallen paladin of a fallen order of knights. He lingers like a ghost in a dead dragon’s lair.</p><p>This card refers to the revenant Sir Godfrey Gwilym (see chapter 7, area Q37). Although initially unwilling to accompany the characters, he will do so if the characters convince him that the honor of the Order of the Silver Dragon can be restored with his help. Doing this requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p><p>B. Ghost (King of Hearts)</p><p>Stir the spirit of the clumsy knight whose crypt lies deep within the castle.</p><p>This card refers to Sir Klutz the phantom warrior (see chapter 4, area K84, crypt 33). If Sir Klutz is Strahd’s enemy, then the phantom warrior disappears not after seven days, but only after he or Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>Executioner (Jack of Spades)</p><p>Seek out the brother of the devil’s bride. They call him “the lesser,” but he has a powerful soul.</p><p>This card refers to Ismark Kolyanovich (see chapter 3, area E2). Ismark won’t accompany the characters to Castle Ravenloft until he knows that his sister, Ireena Kolyana, is safe.</p><p>A. Horseman (Joker 2)</p><p>I see a dead man of noble birth, guarded by his widow. Return life to the dead man’s corpse, and he will be your staunch ally.</p><p>This card refers to Nikolai Wachter the elder, who is dead (see chapter 5, area N4o). If the characters cast a raise dead spell or a resurrection spell on his preserved corpse, Nikolai (LN male human noble) agrees to help the characters once he feels well enough, despite his wife’s protests. Although his family has long supported Strahd, Nikolai came to realize toward the end of his life that Strahd must be destroyed to save Barovia.</p><p>If the characters don’t have the means to raise Nikolai from the dead, Rictavio (see appendix D) gives them a spell scroll of raise dead if he learns of their need. If they’re staying at the Blue Water Inn, he leaves the scroll in one of their rooms.</p><p>B. Horseman (Joker 2)</p><p>A man of death named Arrigal will forsake his dark lord to serve your cause. Beware! He has a rotten soul.</p><p>This card refers to the Vistani assassin Arrigal (see chapter 5, area N9c). If the characters mention this card reading to him, he accepts his fate and accompanies them. If the characters succeed in defeating Strahd, Arrigal betrays and attacks them, believing that he is destined to become Barovia’s new lord.</p><p>A. Innocent (Queen of Hearts)</p><p>I see a young man with a kind heart. A mother’s boy! He is strong in body but weak of mind. Seek him out in the village of Barovia.</p><p>This card refers to Parriwimple (see chapter 3, area E1). Although he’s a simpleton, he won’t travel to Castle Ravenloft without good cause. Characters can manipulate him into going by preying on his good heart. For instance, he might go there to help rescue missing Barovians, or to save the life of Ireena Kolyana, who is very beautiful. The characters must somehow deal with Bildrath, Parriwimple’s employer, who won’t let the foolish boy go to the castle for any reason.</p><p>B. Innocent (Queen of Hearts)</p><p>Evil’s bride is the one you seek!</p><p>This card refers to Ireena Kolyana (see chapter 3, area E4). Her brother, Ismark, opposes the idea of Ireena’s being taken to Castle Ravenloft, but she insists on going there once the characters tell her about the card reading. Ireena won’t accompany the characters, however, until Kolyan Indirovich’s body is laid to rest in the cemetery.</p><p>A. Marionette (Jack of Hearts)</p><p>What horror is this? I see a man made by a man. Ageless and alone, it haunts the towers of the castle.</p><p>This card refers to Pidlwick II (see chapter 4, area K59, as well as appendix D).</p><p>B. Marionette (Jack of Hearts)</p><p>Look for a man of music, a man with two heads. He lives in a place of great hunger and sorrow.</p><p>This card refers to Clovin Belview (see chapter 8, area S17), the two-headed mongrelfolk. Clovin serves the Abbot out of fear and a perverse sense of loyalty. His job is to deliver food to the other mongrelfolk, whom he abhors. If the Abbot still lives, Clovin doesn’t want to earn his Master’s ire by attempting to leave, and he refuses to accompany the characters. But if the Abbot dies, Clovin doesn’t have any reason to remain in the abbey, so he’s willing to come along if he is bribed with wine. Clovin provides no benefit to the party without his viol.</p><p>Mists (Queen of Spades)</p><p>A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia’s abbey, near the mists.</p><p>This card refers to Ezmerelda d’Avenir (see appendix D). She can be found in the Abbey of Saint Markovia (see chapter 8, area S19), as well as several other locations throughout Barovia.</p><p>Raven (Queen of Clubs)</p><p>Find the leader of the feathered ones who live among the vines. Though old, he has one more fight left in him.</p><p>This card refers to Davian Martikov (see chapter 12, “The Wizard of Wines”). The old wereraven, realizing that he has a chance to end Strahd’s tyranny, leaves his vineyard and winery in the capable hands of his sons, Adrian and Elvir. But before he travels to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd, Davian insists on reconciling with his third son, Urwin Martikov (see chapter 5, area N2).</p><p>A. Tempter (Queen of Diamonds)</p><p>I see a child—a Vistana. You must hurry, for her fate hangs in the balance. Find her at the lake!</p><p>This card refers to Arabelle (see chapter 2, area L). She gladly joins the party. But if she returns to her camp (chapter 5, area N9), her father, Luvash, refuses to let her leave.</p><p>B. Tempter (Queen of Diamonds)</p><p>I hear a wedding bell, or perhaps a death knell. It calls thee to a mountainside abbey, wherein you will find a woman who is more than the sum of her parts.</p><p>This card refers to Vasilka the flesh golem (see chapter 8, area S13).</p><h3>Strahd’s Location in the Castle</h3><p>Drawn from the high deck, the fifth card in the card reading determines the location of the final showdown with Strahd—the place in Castle Ravenloft where the characters are sure to find him. The first time the characters arrive at the foretold location, Strahd is there, provided he hasn’t been forced back into his coffin.</p><p>Artifact (Joker 1)</p><p>He lurks in the darkness where the morning light once shone—a sacred place.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in the chapel (area K15).</p><p>Beast (Jack of Diamonds)</p><p>The beast sits on his dark throne.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in the audience hall (area K25).</p><p>Broken One (King of Diamonds)</p><p>He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in Sergei’s tomb (area K85).</p><p>Darklord (King of Spades)</p><p>He lurks in the depths of darkness, in the one place to which he must return.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in his tomb (area K86).</p><p>Donjon (King of Clubs)</p><p>He lurks in a hall of bones, in the dark pits of his castle.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in the hall of bones (area K67).</p><p>Seer (Jack of Clubs)</p><p>He waits for you in a place of wisdom, warmth, and despair. Great secrets are there.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in the study (area K37).</p><p>Ghost (King of Hearts)</p><p>Look to the father’s tomb.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (area K88).</p><p>Executioner (Jack of Spades)</p><p>I see a dark figure on a balcony, looking down upon this tortured land with a twisted smile.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters at the overlook (area K6).</p><p>Horseman (Joker 2)</p><p>He lurks in the one place to which he must return—a place of death.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in his tomb (area K86).</p><p>Innocent (Queen of Hearts)</p><p>He dwells with the one whose blood sealed his doom, a brother of light snuffed out too soon.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in Sergei’s tomb (area K85).</p><p>Marionette (Jack of Hearts)</p><p>Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in the north tower peak (area K60).</p><p>Mists (Queen of Spades)</p><p>The cards can’t see where the evil lurks. The mists obscure all!</p><p>The card offers no clue about where the final showdown with Strahd will occur. It can happen anywhere you like in Castle Ravenloft. Alternatively, Madam Eva tells the characters to return to her after at least three days, and she will consult the cards again for them, but only to discern the location of their enemy.</p><p>Raven (Queen of Clubs)</p><p>Look to the mother’s tomb.</p><p>Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (area K88).</p><p>Tempter (Queen of Diamonds)</p><p>I see a secret place—a vault of temptation hidden behind a woman of great beauty. The evil waits atop his tower of treasure.</p><p>Strahd confronts the characters in the treasury (area K41). “A woman of great beauty” refers to the portrait of Tatyana hanging in the castle’s study (area K37), which contains a secret door that leads to the treasury.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Adventure Hooks","type":"text","_id":"ATv41yNsLKpz7AGl","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Adventure Hooks</p><p>In the event that begins the adventure, the fates of Strahd and the adventurers are entwined as the characters are invited or forced into his domain. Different ways to get the adventurers to Barovia are described in the sections that follow. Use whichever one you favor.</p><p>In “Plea for Help,” a colorfully dressed stranger approaches the characters while they are staying at a tavern. The stranger delivers a letter from his master, inviting them to the village of Barovia with an urgent request for their assistance. If the characters take the bait, the fog engulfs them as they cross into Strahd’s domain.</p><p>In “Mysterious Visitors,” the characters are asked to scare off a band of rowdy travelers who are camped outside the town of Daggerford, on the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The travelers welcome the characters to their camp and invite them to sit by their fire while their elder recounts a tragic tale of a cursed yet noble prince. The characters, lulled into a trance by the fire, awaken to find themselves on a foggy road, delivered to Barovia by their Vistani hosts.</p><p>In “Werewolves in the Mist,” the characters are drawn together by a series of werewolf attacks. The hunt for this pack of lycanthropes leads the characters into a forest, where they are swept into the land of Barovia. This hook assumes the use of the five factions featured in the Adventurers League.</p><p>In “Creeping Fog,” the characters are traveling a lonely road through the woods when the fog engulfs them, spiriting them away to the land of Barovia.</p><p>Plea for Help</p><p>The characters start their adventure in an old tavern, the details of which are for you to decide.</p><p>To a party of seasoned adventurers such as yourselves, what you see is but another dull tavern in another dull town in some nameless province. It is but another span of time between the challenges of true adventuring.</p><p>Outside the tavern, a fog lies over the town this evening. The damp, cobbled pavement glistens as the lights of street lanterns dance across the slick stones. The fog chills the bones and shivers the soul of anyone outside.</p><p>Yet inside these tavern walls the food is hearty, and the ale is warm and frothy. A fire blazes in the hearth, and the tavern is alive with the tumbling voices of country folk.</p><p>Suddenly, the tavern door swings open, and a hush falls over the room. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His heavy, booted footfalls and the jingle of his coins shatter the silence. His brightly colored clothes are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. Without hesitation, he walks up to your table and stands proudly in a wide stance with folded arms.</p><p>In an accented voice he says, “I have been sent to you to deliver this message. If you be creatures of honor, you will come to my Master’s aid at first light. It is not advisable to travel the Svalich Woods at night!” He pulls from his tunic a sealed letter, addressed to all of you in beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table. “Take the west road from here some five hours march down through the Svalich Woods. There you will find my master in Barovia.”</p><p>Amid the silent stares of the patronage, the man strides to the bar and says to the wary barkeep, “Fill the glasses, one and all. Their throats are obviously parched.” He drops a purse heavy with gold on the bar. With that, he leaves.</p><p>The babble of tavern voices resumes, although somewhat subdued. The letter is lying before you. The seal is in the shape of a crest you don’t recognize.</p><p>STRAHD’S CREST</p><p>The characters can interrupt the messenger at any time. His name is Arrigal (NE male human assassin), and he is a Vistani. The other tavern patrons regard his people as friendly folk who travel about in covered wagons and usually keep to themselves.</p><p>Arrigal describes Barovia as a valley of great beauty and his master as a remarkable man. If the characters question Arrigal about the identity of his master, he claims to serve Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, but in truth he serves Strahd. After delivering the letter, Arrigal mounts his horse and rides off. He doesn’t wait for the characters to follow him.</p><p>The crest depicted on the letter’s seal belongs to Strahd, though the characters have never seen it before. Show the players Strahd’s crest.</p><p>The letter, which seems to have been written by the burgomaster, was actually penned by Strahd. If the characters read the letter, show the players “Kolyan Indirovich’s Letter (Version 1)” in appendix F. The letter is bait to lure the adventurers to Barovia. If the characters take the bait, they arrive at area A (see chapter 2, “The Lands of Barovia”).</p><p>Mysterious Visitors</p><p>The details of this adventure hook assume that your D&amp;D campaign is based in or near Daggerford, a town on the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms, but you can change the location to suit your campaign.</p><p>Duchess Morwen of Daggerford is having guests for dinner—and you are invited. No strangers to Daggerford, you have come to the town’s defense on more than one occasion, and you count Lady Morwen as a friend and a benefactor.</p><p>A cool autumn breeze blows through the streets as you make your way to the keep. As you dine on hot, spicy soup and tenderly cooked pheasant, you can tell that the duchess seems more out of sorts than usual. Then a pall comes over the occasion as she voices her concern about a band of wayward travelers camped outside the town’s walls. They seemed harmless at first, but Morwen has received reports that they have begun harassing townsfolk and other visitors as they come and go, demanding money and wine, and threatening to put hexes on anyone who doesn’t pay up.</p><p>Yesterday, the duchess ordered several guards to scare away the mysterious visitors, but they couldn’t get the job done. When the guards returned, they spoke sympathetically about the visitors. It seemed as if the guards had been magically charmed.</p><p>Morwen doesn’t want an armed conflict, but she aims to send a stern message to the visitors and asks you to deliver it on her behalf. “If they don’t leave before dawn,” she says, “I’ll burn their wagons to the ground.”</p><p>The characters are asked to deliver Duchess Morwen’s message immediately after dinner.</p><p>The travelers are camped on the hill outside the gates of Daggerford, near the road. Guards atop the walls watch the camp closely at all hours.</p><p>When the characters approach the camp, read:</p><p>As the evening grows dark, you see a dozen men and women gathered around a crackling bonfire. The folk are in good spirits. A few of them sing and dance around the fire while others find happiness in their flasks and wineskins. Three barrel-topped wagons are parked at odd angles. Tied to a nearby tree, grazing, are half a dozen draft horses wearing bright coats with bangles and tassels.</p><p>The men and women are Vistani. They have no interest in Daggerford. Their orders are to deliver the characters safely to Barovia.</p><p>The leader of this group is Stanimir (CN male human), an old man with the statistics of a mage who has the following spells prepared:</p><p>Cantrips (at will): friends, light, mage hand, prestidigitation</p><p>1st level (4 slots): charm person, mage armor, shield, sleep</p><p>2nd level (3 slots): misty step, suggestion</p><p>3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, phantom steed, vampiric touch</p><p>4th level (3 slots): greater invisibility, stoneskin</p><p>5th level (1 slot): dominate person</p><p>Stanimir is joined by his daughter, Damia (CN female human spy), and his son, Ratka (CN male human bandit captain). Nine other Vistani (male and female bandits) heed Ratka’s commands. The six draft horses are used to pull the Vistani wagons, which contain their belongings but nothing of value.</p><p>The Dancing Fire</p><p>Stanimir introduces himself and welcomes the characters to his camp. If they deliver Duchess Morwen’s warning, read:</p><p>Stanimir laughs. “Don’t worry. We have no wish to make enemies of Lady Morwen. I have a story to tell all of you. First you listen, then we go.”</p><p>If the characters agree to hear Stanimir’s story, he invites them to gather around the fire and hear his tale:</p><p>Stanimir fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire. The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire’s core.</p><p>“We come from an ancient land whose name is long forgotten—a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from our homes, and now we wander the lost roads.”</p><p>The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.</p><p>Stanimir continues. “One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn’t say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn’t give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves.”</p><p>Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.</p><p>“This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, ‘I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will always be safe here.’”</p><p>The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.</p><p>Stanimir’s face becomes a somber mask. “A curse has befallen our noble prince, turning him into a tyrant. We alone have the power to leave his domain. We’ve traveled far and wide to find heroes such as yourselves to end our dread lord’s curse and put his troubled soul to rest. Our leader, Madam Eva, knows all. Will you return to Barovia with us and speak with her?”</p><p>These Vistani refuse to speak the name of their “dread lord” and provide no additional information. If the characters press them for details, the Vistani reply, “Madam Eva has the answers you seek.”</p><p>If the characters agree to accompany the Vistani, the Vistani lead them south along the Trade Way. After several days of uneventful travel, the mists of Ravenloft engulf the caravan, transporting the characters and the Vistani to Barovia. The Vistani then lead the party safely to their leader, Madam Eva, at area G (see chapter 2). The characters arrive at area A and are taken through areas B, E, and F on the way to Madam Eva’s camp. If the characters rid themselves of their Vistani hosts before reaching Madam Eva’s camp, they’re on the own.</p><p>If the characters decline Stanimir’s invitation, the Vistani are disappointed but leave as promised. A day or two later, use the “Creeping Fog” adventure hook or some variation of it to draw the characters into Barovia.</p><p>Werewolves in the Mist</p><p>This adventure hook assumes you’re running a campaign in or near Daggerford (see “Mysterious Visitors” for more information). It also assumes you’re using the five player factions featured in the Adventurers League.</p><p>“Werewolves in the mist!” You’ve heard these dreaded words spoken again and again by farmers, merchants, and adventurers alike. The hamlets east of Daggerford have fallen prey to a pack of werewolves that spills out of the Misty Forest on nights of the full moon, cloaked in crawling mist that seems to follow them wherever they go. The beasts spread death and mayhem, slaughtering adults and stealing children before retreating back into the woods. Others have tried to combat the werewolf menace, with little success.</p><p>The Misty Forest lies thirty miles east of Daggerford. Before the characters embark on their quest, those who have faction allegiances receive additional information described in the sections that follow. Take the players aside, and read them the boxed text for their faction.</p><p>Harpers</p><p>A Harper named Zelraun Roaringhorn knows a metal­smith who will silver your weapons for free. He also provides some helpful magic.</p><p>“We strive to protect the powerless,” he says. “If the children kidnapped by the werewolves are still alive, I would see them safely returned.”</p><p>Zelraun Roaringhorn (LN male human mage) has come to Daggerford to meet with its ruler, Duchess Morwen, and offer the Harpers’ support.</p><p>Zelraun gives each Harper character a spell scroll of remove curse. He has also made arrangements with a metalsmith in Waterdeep to sheathe the characters’ weapons in silver. The party can have up to six weapons silvered in this manner. Twenty pieces of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose.</p><p>About the Harpers. The Harpers is a network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and who covertly oppose the abuse of power. The organization’s longevity is largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms. They share information with one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers’ ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their ingenuity and incorruptibility.</p><p>Order of the Gauntlet</p><p>You met with the heads of the Order of the Gauntlet chapter house in Waterdeep. They’ve stationed members of the order at various inns and homesteads east of Daggerford, so that locals need not fear the night. Now they’re counting on you to find the werewolves’ lair in the Misty Forest. Only then can the order mount an organized assault. As you prepare to depart, a knight of the order named Lanniver Strayl offers you his blessing.</p><p>Lanniver Strayl (LG male human knight), a devout follower of Tyr recently arrived in Daggerford, gives a potion of heroism to each member of the order in the party.</p><p>About the Order of the Gauntlet. Founded by paladins and clerics of Helm, Torm, and Tyr, the order is a dedicated group of like-minded individuals driven by religious zeal or a finely honed sense of justice and honor. The order is ready to lash out the moment evil acts, and not a moment before. The order strikes hard and fast, without waiting for the blessings of temples or the permission of rulers. The order believes that evil must be smashed, or it will swiftly overcome all.</p><p>Emerald Enclave</p><p>You don’t need to consult with others in the Emerald Enclave to know that the werewolves are upsetting the natural order. For balance to be restored, they must be eradicated. It seems the gods of nature agree, for they’ve sent good weather and preserved the monsters’ tracks.</p><p>Members of the Emerald Enclave in the party gain inspiration whenever the party kills a werewolf.</p><p>About the Emerald Enclave. This widespread group of wilderness survivalists preserves the natural order while rooting out unnatural threats. Druids, rangers, and barbarians make up most of its membership.</p><p>Branches of the organization can be found wherever untamed wilderness exists. Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive, and more important, they want to help others do the same. They aren’t opposed to civilization or progress, but they strive to prevent civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another.</p><p>Lords’ Alliance</p><p>A Lords’ Alliance operative from Waterdeep named Eravien Haund comes to Daggerford bearing news that alliance agents have not only captured one of the werewolves but also conducted a thorough interrogation before putting the creature out of its misery.</p><p>Eravien Haund (LN male half-elf noble) imparts the following information to fellow Lords’ Alliance members and tells them not to share it:</p><p>The werewolf pack has almost a dozen members. The leader of the pack is a man named Kiril.</p><p>The werewolves come from a distant land called Barovia. The Lords’ Alliance has no information about it.</p><p>The werewolves worship a deity called Mother Night.</p><p>The werewolves leave and return to Barovia through some kind of ancient portal. (This is a deduction on Eravien’s part, based on the werewolf prisoner’s vague description of how the pack gets to and from Barovia.)</p><p>Eravien believes that he can gain prestige within the Lords’ Alliance if he learns the whereabouts of the “ancient portal” that the werewolves are using and destroys it. He is convinced that the portal represents a danger not only to Daggerford but also to Waterdeep. Any Lords’ Alliance character who agrees to destroy it is given a spell scroll of magic weapon. Eravien also promises to furnish the character with a letter of recommendation (see “Marks of Prestige” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) once the portal is destroyed.</p><p>About the Lords’ Alliance. The Lords’ Alliance is a coalition of political powers concerned with their mutual security and prosperity. Heading the coalition are rulers in the North and along the Sword Coast.</p><p>Although alliance members have pledged to join forces against common threats, every lord in it places the fate and fortune of his or her settlement above all others. Agents of the alliance are chosen primarily for their loyalty, and are trained in observation, stealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy, they carry well-made equipment (often disguised to appear common). Alliance operatives are often glory hounds.</p><p>Zhentarim</p><p>The Black Network sees the werewolf menace as an opportunity to provide lords and nervous landowners with mercenaries to protect their holdings. But at least one of your fellow members has a grudge against the lycanthropes. Davra Jassur, a member of the Zhentarim based in Waterdeep, arranges a private meeting with you.</p><p>Davra Jassur (LE female human assassin) poses as a recruiter for the Black Network but is, in fact, a cutthroat who quietly disposes of competitors. Her husband, Yarak, was also a member of the Black Network. He was escorting a caravan traveling from Daggerford to the Way Inn (about sixty miles southeast of Daggerford, along the Trade Way) when the werewolves attacked. Yarak was slain, and Davra wants revenge; she wants the head of the werewolf pack leader. She is too tied up with “business” to engage in a personal vendetta, but if another member of the Black Network were to help, she would owe that individual a special favor (see “Marks of Prestige” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).</p><p>About the Zhentarim. The Zhentarim is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence throughout the Forgotten Realms. The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, both legal and illicit, hoping to undercut its competitors.</p><p>Members of the Zhentarim think of themselves as members of an extended family and rely on it for resources and security. At the same time, members are granted the autonomy to increase their own wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises “the best for the best,” although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than investing in the improvement of its members.</p><p>Welcome to Barovia</p><p>Strahd is using the werewolves to lure adventurers to his domain. Characters can follow the werewolves’ tracks into the Misty Forest. After hours of fruitless searching, the characters are engulfed by thick fog:</p><p>The woods darken as the trees begin to close ranks, their needle-covered arms interlocking to blot out the sun. The shroud of mist that covers the ground turns into creeping walls of gray fog that silently envelop you until you can’t see more than a few feet in any direction. Soon, even the werewolf tracks disappear.</p><p>No matter which direction they go, the characters come to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to area A (see chapter 2). As an alternative, you can have them enter Barovia near Krezk (see chapter 8).</p><p>Creeping Fog</p><p>This scenario assumes that the characters are camping in a forest when the fog engulfs them. They are quietly borne to the edge of Barovia.</p><p>The woods are quiet this night, and the air grows chill. Your fire sputters as a low mist gathers around the edges of your camp, growing closer as the night wears on. By morning, the fog hangs thick in the air, turning the trees around you into gray ghosts. Then you notice these aren’t the same trees that surrounded you the night before.</p><p>No matter which direction they go, the characters come to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to area A (see chapter 2). As an alternative, you can have them enter Barovia near Krezk (see chapter 8).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"dd9928cc6f5c2e15f1361a315685f6f58dcda255","sourceId":"JournalEntry.mIf9fwdtDGTuAVfd"},"cf":{"id":"temp_yr0crbxvuec","path":"Curse of Strahd","color":"#98020a"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672450850169,"modifiedTime":1677352300080,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"mIf9fwdtDGTuAVfd","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

It makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score. If the claw loses the contest, the character sees the claw enter the backpack. If the claw wins the contest, it waits until the character takes a long rest before scuttling out to attack.</p><h4>Crawling Strahd Zombie</h4><blockquote><p>You hear the deathly groans of something vile.</p></blockquote><p>The groans are coming from a @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.tgi7S3VydIeW4I7m]{Strahd zombie} that is missing both of its legs, so that only its head, torso, and arms remain. It uses its arms to drag itself across the floor. The crawling zombie has 15 hit points remaining.</p><p>If the characters are moving quietly and not using light sources, they can try to hide from the crawling zombie.</p><h3>Random Encounters (D-S)</h3><h4>Ezmerelda d’Avenir</h4><p>Ezmerelda has cast a greater invisibility spell on herself and is stealthily exploring the castle. Choose one character in the back rank of the party’s marching order, and read the following text to that character’s player:</p><blockquote><p>You feel a gentle tap on your shoulder but see nothing behind you.</p></blockquote><p>If the character who is touched by Ezmerelda reacts in an alarming or threatening manner, she hastily whispers, “Don’t be frightened. We’re on the same side.”</p><p>Ezmerelda is hunting Strahd, but her efforts to corner the vampire have so far been thwarted, and she fears that she might be in over her head. If the characters don’t ask her to join the party, she wishes them well and goes on her way (perhaps to be encountered again later). If they invite her to accompany them, Ezmerelda tests the characters’ knowledge about vampires by asking them questions such as “Have you ever seen a vampire change its form?” and “Do you know how to counteract a vampire’s regenerative ability?” Whatever their answers, she ultimately agrees to come along.</p><p>This random encounter happens only once. If this result comes up again, treat it as no encounter.</p><h4>Flying Swords</h4><blockquote><p>Out of the gloom flies a rusty blade, followed by another!</p></blockquote><p>If more than two @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.E9K2yaqFIeyeHvmY]{flying swords} are encountered, the others aren’t far behind. These weapons drift about the castle and attack intruders within range of their blindsight.</p><h4>Giant Spider Cocoon</h4><p>A giant spider cocoon is encountered only if the characters are moving about the castle (not resting); otherwise, reroll.</p><blockquote><p>A white cocoon is suspended from the ceiling amid thick webs and appears to hold something human-like.</p></blockquote><p>A giant spider made this cocoon. Characters who can reach it can cut it open to free whatever is inside. Roll a d6 to determine the cocoon’s contents: @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.rolltables.dlp68Er2v1Ces4uG]{Cocoons Contents}</p><h4>Rahadin</h4><p>If Rahadin was killed or captured in a previous encounter, this encounter doesn’t occur. Otherwise, Strahd’s mysterious chamberlain approaches quietly. A character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds Rahadin’s Dexterity (Stealth) check hear him.</p><blockquote><p>“The master wishes to see you,” intones a grim voice in the darkness.</p></blockquote><p>Rahadin directs the characters to a random location in the castle, determined by rolling a d6: @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.rolltables.KkJj59u71tK9R3Si]{Location}</p><p>Strahd isn’t actually at that location unless the card reading (see chapter 1) indicates that he is.</p><p>If the characters ask Rahadin to lead the way, he declines. If the characters ask for directions, he tells them whether they need to ascend, descend, or remain on the level they’re at. If they attack him, he fights to the death. Otherwise, he doesn’t leave until after they do.</p><h4>Shadows</h4><p>If one or more characters have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, read:</p><blockquote><p>You can’t shake the feeling that something is behind you. When you look back, you see a shadow, tall and still, but nothing of its dimensions that could cast it.</p></blockquote><p>If more than one @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.hn5dRx1c8EtHfSTH]{shadow} is present, the others are close by but hidden in the darkness. These undead shadows follow the characters but do not attack unless attacked first. They otherwise obey Strahd’s commands.</p><h4>Strahd von Zarovich</h4><p>Strahd makes a surprise appearance.</p><blockquote><p>A crack of thunder shakes the castle, stirring the dust and cobwebs. You hear a voice: “Good evening.”</p></blockquote><p>Any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score lower than 19 is surprised as Strahd appears seemingly out of nowhere. The vampire prefers to attack a surprised character, choosing the one closest to him. Otherwise, see appendix D for the vampire’s tactics.</p><h4>Swarms of Bats</h4><p>You hear a peal of thunder, followed by the flapping of tiny black wings. Suddenly, a dark cloud of bats descends upon you!</p><p>These @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.nackraWSOTYmZj8i]{bats} are the servants of Strahd. They attack the characters without provocation.</p><h3>Random Encounters (T-Z)</h3><h4>Trinket</h4><p>One random character finds a lost trinket. Read the following text to the player of that character:</p><blockquote><p>You kick something—a trinket buried in the dust.</p></blockquote><p>To determine what the character finds, roll on the @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.rolltables.Tsz4uoT2lpTpLDiw]{Gothic Trinkets} table.</p><h4>Unseen Servant</h4><blockquote><p>A curious object drifts into view, as though held aloft by an invisible force.</p></blockquote><p>This unseen servant was created by Strahd and is permanent until destroyed (see the @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-9-spells.gV2Y5zBuKsIqDv5I]{unseen servant} spell in the Player’s Handbook). Roll a d6 to determine what the servant is carrying, or choose one of the options below.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.rolltables.RsF8DCDnz72D8WAA]{Items}</p><h4>Vampire Spawn</h4><p>If any character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, the party isn’t surprised. In that case, read:</p><blockquote><p>Creatures with pale flesh scuttle across the ceiling like spiders, their red eyes glowing in the dark. As they draw near, their cracked and bloodstained lips open wide, revealing sharp fangs.</p></blockquote><p>These minions of Strahd—former adventurers all—creep along ceilings and drop down on unsuspecting prey. The @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.v1xFGVuVvCzSfmsw]{vampire spawn} fight until destroyed.</p><h4>Vistani Thugs</h4><blockquote><p>You hear voices with thick accents.</p></blockquote><p>A small group of Vistani (NE male and female human @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.YUhPf3Hl0LFnfa47]{thugs}) claim that they were the vampire’s captives, only recently escaped from the castle’s dungeon, and they offer to help the party. In truth, they are loyal to Strahd and betray the characters as soon as he appears. If the characters accept their offer, the Vistani pretend to be the party’s allies for as long as they remain with the party, or until Strahd appears. If the characters leave the castle, the Vistani accompany them, since choosing to remain in the castle would likely arouse the characters’ suspicion.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> One Vistani thug carries a pouch that holds 2d8 small gemstones (50 gp each).</p><h4>Wights</h4><blockquote><p>The air grows much colder, and you can hear the march of footsteps drawing near.</p></blockquote><p>If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from the @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.hijWMdl0xHpVx8Ka]{wights}. These undead soldiers once served as guard captains in Castle Ravenloft. They still wear bits of tattered livery, and they attack the living on sight.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The wights carry longswords that have the crest of Barovia worked into their cross guards.

Front Courtyard</h3><p>As the characters enter the castle, the weather worsens. Dismal rain starts to fall, becoming a torrent within the hour. Lightning routinely lights the sky, followed by peals of thunder that make the castle shudder.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Thick, cold fog swirls in this courtyard. Sporadic flashes of lightning lance the weeping clouds overhead as thunder shakes the ground. Through the drizzle, you see torch flames fluttering on each side of the keep’s open main doors. Warm light spills out of the entrance, flooding the courtyard. High above the entrance is a round window with shards of broken glass lodged in its iron frame.</p></aside><p>The walls that enclose the courtyard are 90 feet high. The dark towers of the castle rise even higher. Doors in the gate towers on each side of the tunnel entrance are shut against the rain, and a howling wind rushes through the courtyard.</p><p>The open main doors to the keep lead to area K7. The large, shattered window overlooking the main entrance is 50 feet above the courtyard and leads to area K25. No light can be seen through the great window.</p><h4>Gate Towers</h4><p>Each outer gate tower has an ironbound door with a built-in lock.</p><p>Characters who enter a gate tower find themselves on a flagstone floor with a hollow tower stretching high above them. The mechanisms for raising and lowering the drawbridge and portcullis fill both gate towers. The latch mechanism in each tower is magically activated by a word that only Strahd knows. It can also be activated with a successful casting of @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-9-spells.ZQaPrVNkkwaLobim]{dispel magic} (DC 14). Neither the drawbridge nor the portcullis will move until both latches are activated.</p><h3>K2. Center Court Gate</h3><p>Two gates, one north of the keep and one to the south, prevent easy access to what lies beyond them.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A massive wall juts out to connect the outer walls of the castle with the keep. A twenty-foot-wide, twenty-foot-tall archway offers passage through the connecting wall but is blocked by a rusting iron portcullis.</p></aside><p>The portcullis is unlocked and can be lifted with a successful DC 15 Strength check. It can also be opened with a command word that only Strahd and Cyrus Belview (area K62) know. Unless the portcullis is wedged or propped open, it falls back into place once it is let go.</p><h3>K3. Servants’ Courtyard</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This courtyard northeast of the keep is enclosed by towering walls. A stone carriage house with hinged wooden doors stands silent in the corner where the outer walls meet. Across from the carriage house, a slender wooden door reinforced with iron bands leads into the keep.</p></aside><p>The carriage house is described in area K4. The wooden door, which leads to area K23, is swollen and stuck in its frame. A character can shoulder open the stuck door with a successful DC 10 Strength check.</p><h3>K4. Carriage House</h3><p>Read the following text if the characters open the carriage house doors:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The double doors swing open to reveal a sleek, black carriage fitted with glass windows and brass lanterns.</p></aside><h3>K5. Chapel Garden</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>At the back of the keep, behind towering buttresses and tall, boarded-up stained-glass windows, a small garden struggles to survive. Small flowers press skyward against the gloom. A pair of large iron gates blocks the way to some kind of overlook.</p></aside><p>The large iron gates squeal loudly on rusted hinges when opened. Beyond them lies area K6.</p><h3>K6. Overlook</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dark clouds overhead drizzle constantly. A flagstone avenue passes between empty outbuildings, leading to a stone-paved overlook. The overlook has a low stone wall adorned with outward-facing gargoyle carvings.</p></aside><p>If a character peers over the balcony, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A flash of lightning illuminates the dismal village of Barovia, its rooftops visible above a smothering blanket of fog one thousand feet below.</p></aside><p>If a character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher peers over the wall, add:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Underneath the platform on which you stand, about one hundred feet down, a stone construction protrudes from the cliff face. Three dirt-caked windows are set into it.</p></aside><p>The windows are so dirty as to be opaque, although a character within reach of one can scrape the dirt away and see a dusty tomb beyond (area K88). Characters who try to reach the windows from the overlook must descend 110 feet and move 20 feet back under the platform. This descent can’t be accomplished without the aid of magic or the use of a climber’s kit.</p><p>Anyone who falls from the overlook plummets 1,000 feet.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is looking out over the balcony.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Main Floor","type":"text","_id":"AbPIwdNDDwiVYBKm","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Refer to map 3 of the castle for areas K7 through K24.</p><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/maps/Curse%20of%20Strahd/Castle%20Ravenloft/standard/cos-006.jpg\" /><h3>K7. Entry</h3><p>Read the following text if the characters approach from the courtyard (area K1):</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The ornate outer doors of the castle hang open, flanked by fluttering torches in iron sconces. Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors.</p></aside><p>If one or more characters approach from area K1 and come within 10 feet of the double doors, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The doors in front of you suddenly swing open, revealing a grand hall filled with the sound of organ music.</p></aside><p>If the characters approach from area K8 and have not yet visited this area, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A set of double doors to the west appears to be, or to lead to, an exit from the castle.</p></aside><p>If the characters enter from either direction, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Overhead, in the vaulted entry foyer, four statues of dragons glare down, their eyes flickering in the torchlight.</p></aside><p>If anyone except Strahd enters this area through the doors that adjoin area K8, the dragons come alive, drop to the floor hissing and spitting, and attack. The dragons don’t attack characters who enter this area from area K1, heading east. The dragons are four @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.4MYIrK0ZxFrbK4jU]{red dragon wyrmlings}, and they have instructions to allow guests to enter the castle, but not to leave it. If intruders vacate this area, the dragons fly up to their perches and revert to stone. In their stone forms, they are impervious to weapon damage. The dragons never leave the room.</p><h3>K8. Great Entry</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Cobwebs stretch between the columns that support the vaulted ceiling of a great, dusty hall dimly lit by sputtering torches in iron sconces. The torches cast odd shadows across the faces of eight stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by decay. Double doors of bronze stand closed to the east. To the north, a wide staircase climbs into darkness. A lit hallway to the south contains another set of bronze doors, through which you hear sad and majestic organ tones.</p></aside><p>The southern hallway is described in area K9. The wide staircase leads up to area K19.</p><p>If the characters are here by invitation, add the following:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>An elf with brown skin and long black hair descends the wide staircase, quiet as a cat. He wears a gray cloak over black studded leather armor and has a polished scimitar hanging from his belt. “My master is expecting you,” he says.</p></aside><p>The elf is @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.CsnpEhe9T8oHiNmo]{Rahadin}, the castle chamberlain. He fights only if attacked. Otherwise, he leads the characters to the dining hall (area K10), points them inside, pulls the doors shut behind them, and withdraws to area K72 by way of the South Tower Stair (area K21).</p><h4>Development</h4><p>After all the characters leave this room, the eight gargoyles attack any character who dares to return. The gargoyles also swoop down to fight if they are attacked. When the gargoyles attack, the turbulence in the air from their wings extinguishes the feeble torches in the sconces, plunging the hall into darkness unless the characters have light sources.</p><h3>K9. Guests’ Hall</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Torchlight flutters against the walls of this vaulted hall. To the east, an arched hallway stretches for twenty feet, ending at a spiral staircase that goes up and down.</p><p>Next to the hallway, a suit of armor, oiled and glistening, stands at attention in a shallow alcove. Veins of ruby red run along the legs and arms, as if outlining blood vessels. Against the flickering light, you could swear you see them pulsate slowly with an inner glow.</p><p>To the west, large double doors hang slightly open, and a steady bright light escapes through the opening.</p></aside><p>Close inspection reveals that it is clearly magical full plate armor, conferring a +1 to AC. Inside the armor are adjustable straps that allow it to fit nearly any medium humanoid.</p><p>The armor is not all it seems, however. At will, Strahd may cast command on any character wearing this armor, and the wearer automatically fails their saving throw against the spell. Strahd uses this ability sparingly, waiting for the moment of maximum effect. The curse cannot be revealed by any magic, including the identify spell.</p><p>The staircase leads down to area K61 and up to area K30. The double doors provide access to area K10.</p><h3>K10. Dining Hall</h3><p>The first time the characters enter this room, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Three enormous crystal chandeliers brilliantly illuminate this magnificent chamber. Pillars of stone stand against dull white marble walls, supporting the ceiling. In the center of the room, a long, heavy table is covered with a fine white satin cloth. The table is laden with many delectable foods: roasted beast basted in a savory sauce, roots and herbs of every taste, and sweet fruits and vegetables. Places are set for each of you with fine, delicate china and silver. At each place is a crystal goblet filled with an amber liquid with a delicate, tantalizing fragrance.</p><p>At the center of the far west wall, between floor-to-ceiling mirrors, stands a massive organ. Its pipes blare out a thunderous melody that speaks in its tone of greatness and despair. Seated at the organ, facing away from you, a single caped figure pounds the keys in raptured ecstasy. The figure suddenly stops, and as a deep silence falls over the dining hall, it slowly turns toward you.</p></aside><p>The figure is an illusion of Strahd. It welcomes the characters and invites them to dine. The illusion acts like Strahd and plays the part of the gracious host, speaking kindly and telling the characters that they’re free to explore the castle. “Strahd” might talk about his family or shed light on the castle’s history, but the illusion provides no useful information about the castle’s inhabitants, treasures, or dangers other than to say that the castle doesn’t receive many guests. The illusory vampire converses with the characters for no more than 3 rounds, never moving from the organ bench. When the time is up, or if the illusion is attacked, it simply disappears with a mocking laugh.</p><p>The moment the figure disappears, a fierce, bone-chilling wind rises up and roars through the hall, putting out all open flames. The characters hear the screech of ancient hinges and the solid thud of many heavy doors slamming shut, one after another, into the distance. They also hear the portcullis clang shut and the tired groan of the aged drawbridge pulling up. Finally, unless the doors to this room are being held open, they slam shut (but do not lock). If the characters open the doors, they see that all the torches in areas K7, K8, and K9 have gone out.</p><p>The organ appears locked in place and immovable, but a character who makes a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices scratch marks on the floor that suggest that the organ can be slid outward. A character who tries pushing various keys and pedals discovers that one of the pedals, when depressed, causes the organ to slide outward about 2 feet, allowing access to a secret door in the back wall that swings open into area K11. Because this secret door is hidden behind the organ, it can’t be found and opened until the organ is moved out of the way.</p><p>The food on the table is tasty, the wine delicious.</p><h3>K11. South Archers’ Post</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The castle courtyard is visible through arrow slits in the north and west walls. Leaning against the walls are mirrors of various sizes, some as tall as a human and others small enough to fit in a backpack.</p></aside><p>Each arrow slit is 2½ feet tall and 4 inches wide. The framed mirrors (seventeen in all) used to hang on various walls of the castle. Strahd had them taken down and stored here.</p><p>When a character looks into a mirror, they see themselves—dead. Perhaps they are impaled on a spike, or burnt (but not beyond recognition), or drained of all blood with two puncture wounds on their neck. Possibly their reflection is carrying their own head under one arm. One vision is more horrifying than the next. After the blink of an eye, their reflection returns to normal, leaving them wondering if it was merely a figment of their imagination.</p><p>The reflections in the mirrors here are meant to scare and intimidate the characters, but are otherwise harmless.</p><p>A secret door in the east wall can be pulled open to reveal the back of the pipe organ in area K10. Characters can’t pass through the secret door while the organ is blocking it, and the organ can’t be moved from this side.</p><h3>K12. Turret Post</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A high, domed ceiling caps the thirty-foot-wide octagonal room before you. Frescoes faded with age adorn the ceiling, but their images are impossible to make out. Tall, thin arrow slits look out over the courtyard.</p></aside><p>Each arrow slit is 2½ feet tall and 4 inches wide.</p><h3>K13. Turret Post Access Hall</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This long, narrow corridor runs east to west. Cobwebs fill the hall, obstructing sight beyond a few feet.</p></aside><h3>K14. Hall of Faith</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This grand hall is choked with dust and stretches into darkness ahead. Webs hang from the arched ceiling like drapes, and life-sized statues of knights line the hallway on both sides, their eyes seeming to watch you.</p></aside><p>The statues are harmless. Their moving eyes are a simple optical illusion.</p><p>Double doors stand at both ends of the hall. Above the doors leading to area K15 hangs a symbol of beaten bronze that looks like a rising or setting sun.</p><p>This hall bears its name because it has tested the faith and the force of conviction of many adventurers who came before. Those who enter this hall have the very essence of their soul weighed and measured against their actions inside of Barovia.</p><p>Because Barovia is a demiplane cut off from the realms of the gods, the source of this area’s power is a mystery even to Strahd himself. Nevertheless, something great and mysterious is at work here. Any character who enters this area falls subject to the judgment of a mysterious force.</p><p>As the Dungeon Master, examine the ideals, bonds, and flaws of the characters in this area. If their time in Barovia has been spent in accordance with those character traits, award them a point of inspiration.</p><p>Alternatively, you might choose to award inspiration to a character who has changed or evolved significantly, for good or ill. The goal of the area is not to provide a trap or a setback, but to reward those who have done well from a narrative and character standpoint.</p><h3>K15. Chapel</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dim, colored light filters through tall, broken, and boarded-up windows of stained glass, illuminating the ancient chapel of Ravenloft. A few bats flutter about near the top of the ninety-foot-high domed ceiling. A balcony runs the length of the west wall, fifty feet above the floor. In the center of the balcony, two dark shapes are slumped in tall chairs.</p><p>Benches coated with centuries of dust lie about the floor in jumbled disarray. Beyond this debris, lit by a piercing shaft of light, an altar stands upon a stone platform. The sides of the altar are carved with bas-reliefs of angelic figures entwined with grape vines. The light from above falls directly on a silver statuette. A cloaked figure is draped over the altar, and a black mace lies on the floor near its feet.</p></aside><p>The figure slumped on the altar is all that remains of Gustav Herrenghast, a lawful evil human cleric who tried to obtain the @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.items.zuMnnrvdOfl97EC6]{Icon of Ravenloft} and did not survive the attempt. See “Treasure” below for more information on the icon and Gustav’s possessions.</p><p>A sculpted stone railing cordons off the upstairs balcony, which is described in area K28.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>Gustav Herrenghast’s spirit has not accepted his fate. It yearns to return and take revenge, but his body was burned by the radiant energy of the icon of Ravenloft. When the characters enter the chapel, they become aware of the restless spirit.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A pile of ashes spills from the altar to the ground. A strange chill runs down your spine as a voice like the rustling of robes and the screams of the pyre speaks to you. “It should not have been like this! I do not accept this! There should be nothing good, no light, here to burn like this! Now, YOU shall be my vessel!”</p></aside><p>The spirit of Gustav attempts to possess one of the characters. They have to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or Gustav takes over. If they succeed, they only feel a tremendous chill running from their scalp down their spine before Gustav tries the next character. A character who succeeds on their saving throw cannot be possessed by Gustav again.</p><p>Should Gustav succeed, the possessed character assumes the statistics of a revenant and turns hostile. In order to keep the player involved, consider allowing them to control their character in this battle.</p><p>Gustav leaves a character’s body when it drops to 0 hit points or when a protection from evil and good or remove curse spell is cast on the possessed character. Gustav’s spirit departs if he is expelled from a body or cannot possess anyone.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>The statuette on the altar is an artifact called the @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.items.zuMnnrvdOfl97EC6]{Icon of Ravenloft}. Any evil creature that touches the statuette must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The statuette is safe for all creatures to handle once it is no longer in contact with the altar.</p><p>Gustav’s corpse wears a handsome, fur-lined black cloak embroidered with golden thread (worth 250 gp) and a suit of chain mail, both nonmagical. Gustav’s black mace is a mace of terror.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies on the floor behind the altar.</p><p>If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is among the bats fluttering below the ceiling or he is standing at one end of the chapel—a dark shape in the vast hall.</p><h3>K16. North Chapel Access</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This arched room connects a vast chamber to the east and a staircase that rises to the west. Alcoves in the north and south walls hold eight-foot-tall sculptures of helmed knights with muscular builds. Black shadows fall across their faces.</p></aside><p>The statues are harmless.

South Chapel Access</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This arched room connects a vast chamber to the east and the landing of a staircase to the west. To the left of the landing, the stairs curl down into darkness. To the right, the stairs climb into thick drapes of cobwebs. Alcoves in the north and south walls hold eight-foot-tall sculptures of helmed knights with bright blades. Black shadows obscure their faces.</p></aside><p>The statues are harmless. The vast chamber to the east is the chapel (area K15). The staircase to the west is described in area K18.</p><h3>K18. High Tower Staircase</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The large flagstones of this spiraling staircase lead up and down around a twenty-foot-wide stone core. Cobwebs fill the staircase, making it difficult to see even the ceiling. Heavy beams sag overhead from centuries of supporting weight.</p></aside><p>The staircase starts at area K84 and spirals upward around a central shaft (area K18a), climbing 300 feet to the top of the high tower (area K59).</p><p>A recently constructed masonry wall blocks the staircase 10 feet below the landing west of area K17. A chink in this wall allows gas (or a vampire in gaseous form) to pass from one side of the wall to the other. A character who inspects the wall closely can spot the chink with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. The wall is too sturdy for characters to knock down, but they can create a hole wide enough to crawl through in 1 hour, or reduce the entire wall to a pile of masonry bricks and rubble in 2 hours.</p><p>Thirty feet below the masonry wall and 50 feet above the foot of the steps, a small crack has formed in the outer wall of the stairwell. The crack is 1/2 inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to the castle’s wine cellar (area K63). Characters can notice the crack automatically as they climb or descend the stairs. Widening the crack enough to squeeze through the wall requires major excavation and would take several days.</p><p>The shaft that these stairs wrap around (area K18a) runs vertically from area K59 to area K84 without any holes or obstructions. The inner wall of the stairwell, between the staircase and the shaft, is solid.</p><h3>K18a. High Tower Shaft</h3><p>Characters can access this 10-foot-diameter, 390-foot-tall stone shaft from the top or the bottom of the high tower (areas K59 and K84, respectively).</p><p>The shaft is dark and choked with cobwebs. A rushing wind causes the webs to stir. Climbing the shaft is impossible without the aid of magic or the use of a climber’s kit, since there are few handholds.</p><p>The bats in the catacombs (area K84) fly up the shaft at night, exiting Castle Ravenloft through various arrow slits and holes in the tower’s peak (area K59). After feeding, they return by the same route.</p><h3>K19. Grand Landing</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Massive stairs rise to a landing twenty feet wide by forty feet long. Stone arches support a ceiling covered with frescoes twenty feet overhead. The frescoes depict armored knights on horseback, their finer features faded beyond recognition.</p><p>Dust floats in the air here. At each end of the south wall, a staircase rises into darkness. Between the staircases are twin alcoves, each one containing a standing suit of armor covered with dark stains. Each suit of armor clutches a mace, the “business end” of which is shaped like a dragon’s head. Words engraved on the arches above the suits of armor have been scratched out.</p></aside><p>Both staircases on the south wall climb to area K25. The massive stairs lead down to area K8. Anyone who crosses in front of the alcoves along the south wall activates the suits of armor.</p><p>Both suits of armor are mechanical traps, each one activated by a pressure plate hidden in the floor in front of its alcove. A character who searches for traps in one of these locations notices both pressure plates with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><p>When 40 or more pounds of weight are placed on a pressure plate, the suit of armor nearest to that plate springs forward, flailing its arms and wielding its mace. Any creature standing on a pressure plate when its trap triggers must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the flailing armor. After leaping out and attacking, the armor retracts. The pressure plate resets after 1 minute, after which its armor trap can be triggered again.</p><p>The suits of armor act much like metal puppets—a little joke intended to spook visitors more than damage them. A pressure plate can be disabled by a character who uses thieves’ tools and makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A trap can also be disabled by destroying its suit of armor, which has AC 18, 5 hit points, and immunity to psychic and poison damage.</p><h3>K20. Heart of Sorrow</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>As you enter into this area, you are bathed in the flickering glow of a thousand candles. Set into irregularly spaced alcoves along the spiral staircase that hugs the outer wall, each candle stands above a brass name plate—some faded with the centuries, others gleaming as if installed yesterday.</p><p>A mosaic floor adds a touch of color to the otherwise dark, cold, empty tower that rises above you.</p><p>In the center of the room, another set of stairs leads down.</p></aside><p>The staircase in the center of the floor (area K20a) leads down to area K71. Each name plate bears the name of an adventurer who died attempting to best Strahd inside of Castle Ravenloft.</p><p>The spiral staircase has no railing and connects the main floor of the castle with each level above it. First, the staircase climbs 50 feet to a landing (shown on map 4), from which an open archway leads to area K13. East of that opening is a secret door that conceals a ladder leading down to area K34.</p><p>The stairs ascend another 40 feet to another landing (shown on map 5), with archways that lead to areas K45 and K46, and then climb another 100 feet to a landing beneath the tower’s heart (shown on map 8). The staircase wraps around the heart, ending at the top of the tower (area K60).</p><h4>The Heart</h4><p>The tower, including the spiral staircase, is alive. When the characters set foot on the staircase for the first time, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>As you step onto the spiral staircase you glimpse the full immensity of this tower before you are plunged into darkness. All the candles in wall extinguish as one. Your eyes adjust, the only light a dull red glow of a large crystalline heart near the pinnacle of the tower, and the feeble flickering light of six lowest candles along the stair.</p><p>As you read the nameplates on these lit candles, they name each of you. The weak flames seem ready to flicker out at a moments' notice, much like your own lives.</p></aside><p>Have the characters and the Heart of Sorrow roll initiative. If the characters leave the tower and later return, they can reroll initiative, but the heart’s initiative count doesn’t change.</p><p></p><p>The awakened tower shakes and pitches on the Heart of Sorrow’s initiative count. Any creature on the stairs or hanging on a tower wall at the start of the heart’s turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the base of the tower. Characters who are crawling on the staircase or who lie prone on the stairs succeed automatically.</p><p>The Heart of Sorrow is a 10-foot-diameter red crystal heart that floats near the top of the tower. Characters standing on the nearby stairs can make melee attacks against the heart, provided their weapons have a reach of at least 10 feet. The glass heart has AC 15 and 50 hit points. If the heart is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters, and its crystal shards transform into blood, which rains down on the tower interior and staircase. The destruction of the Heart of Sorrow causes the tower to stop shuddering, and the interior of the tower becomes dark. Destroying the heart earns the characters 1,500 XP.</p><p>Strahd and the Heart of Sorrow are connected, such that any damage Strahd takes is transferred to the heart. If the heart absorbs damage that drops it to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and Strahd takes any leftover damage. The Heart of Sorrow regains all its hit points at dawn if it has at least 1 hit point remaining.</p><p>The Heart of Sorrow is held aloft by the will of Strahd. Casting dispel magic on it has no effect.</p><p><em><strong>Animated Halberds.</strong></em> Mounted on the walls along the section of staircase nearest the heart are ten @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.pUloVLzUkdoaqEdZ]{animated halberds}; use the stat block for the flying sword in the Monster Manual, but increase each halberd’s damage to 1d10 + 1 and reduce its AC to 15. The halberds attack any creature that threatens the Heart of Sorrow.</p><p><em><strong>Vampire Spawn.</strong></em> Strahd senses if any damage is done to the Heart of Sorrow and sends four @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.v1xFGVuVvCzSfmsw]{vampire spawn} to destroy those responsible. These vampire spawn are former adventurers whom Strahd defeated long ago. They use their Spider Climb feature to scuttle along the tower walls and arrive in 3 rounds.</p><p><em><strong>Alternative</strong></em>. Volenta makes her stand here. As a master trapper, she has laid two traps of her choice and both are active. She does not intend to kill the characters; that is up to her Lord Strahd - but she protects the Heart at all cost.</p><h3>K20a. Tower Hall Stair</h3><p>This stairway connects areas K20 and K71.</p><h3>K21. South Tower Stair</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Fluttering torches in iron sconces illuminate this spiral staircase. A chill wind rushes down the circling stairway, seeming to kill the very heat of the torches.</p></aside><p>These stairs start at area K73 and go up through areas K61, K9, K30, and K35 before ending at area K47.</p><h3>K22. North Archers’ Post</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The castle courtyard is visible through arrow slits in the walls.</p></aside><p>Each arrow slit is 2½ feet tall and 4 inches wide.</p><h3>K23. Servants’ Entrance</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dim light filters in through a dust-caked window in the east wall. A door next to the window leads to the castle’s northeast courtyard.Everything in this room is coated with dust, including a large, heavy table in the center of the floor. A thick book lies open on a desk, with an inkwell and a quill next to it. There is a broken door in the north wall, and a staircase in the south wall plunges into darkness. On each side of the staircase, a skeletal figure draped in gleaming chain mail stands sagging at attention, holding a rusty halberd.</p></aside><p>The skeletons, which were assembled by Cyrus Belview (see area K62), are held together with wire frames and hung on pegs.

Audience Hall</h3><p>See @UUID[.JpTOuNCoqE1LDVAB]{K25. Audience Hall}</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dim light from the courtyard falls into this great hall through the broken glass and iron latticework of a large window in the west wall. This immense room is a place of chilly, brooding darkness. Empty iron sconces dot the walls. Hundreds of dust-laden cobwebs drape the hall, hiding the ceiling from view. Directly across from the window stand a set of double doors in the east wall. Farther south, a single door also leads from the east wall. Staircases at both ends of the north wall lead down.</p><p>At the far southern end of the hall, a large wooden throne stands atop a marble dais. The high-backed throne faces south, away from most of the room.</p></aside><p>Strahd keeps two items of personal value at his throne: a letter from his brother Sergei is hidden in a secret compartment in the right armrest, and the @UUID[Item.HpHoLIS9kSby6QCw]{Ba’al Verzi knife} used in the assassination attempt on Strahd pierces the velvet of the armrest.</p><p>The Ba’al Verzi knife is a rare magical dagger with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. It ignores any non-magical armor that isn’t adamantine or natural armor, so attacks made with this dagger against any creature not equipped with such armor are against an AC of 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier. The dagger magically slips through armor and clothes, leaving behind no trace of piercing. Players score a critical hit on a 19-20 when attacking with the Ba’al Verzi knife.</p><p>A character that pulls out the knife or investigates the throne more closely can spot the secret compartment with a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception). Upon opening the compartment, they find a @UUID[JournalEntry.MEKGYgEWeC7KP4VR]{letter} that has been crumpled into a ball.</p><p>A secret door in the south wall leads to area K13. It is hidden by dust and cobwebs, and requires a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.</p><p>Both staircases in the north wall lead down to area K19. The eastern double doors can be pulled open to reveal area K26 beyond. The single door in the east wall opens into area K30.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies on the marble dais, just behind the throne.</p><p>If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is sitting on the wooden throne.</p><h3>K26. Guards’ Post</h3><p>If the characters enter this hall through either set of double doors, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The doors open to reveal another set of double doors ten feet ahead. Between these doors, a ten-foot-wide corridor stretches north to south. At each end of the hall, a pair of human skeletons clad in the rusted armor and tattered livery of a castle guard slowly rise to attention.</p></aside><p><s>The “floating” skeletons hang from pegs on the north and south walls. The skeletons, which were assembled by Cyrus Belview (see area K62), are held together with wire and are harmless.</s> Behind the skeleton on the north wall is a secret door that can be pushed open into area K33.</p><p>If the characters enter this hall by way of the secret door that adjoins area K33, they see the skeleton hanging on the inside of the secret door as soon as they pull it open, and, with a light source or darkvision, can see the skeleton at the south end of the hall as well.</p><p>The four skeletons here have not been placed by Cyrus, but are the remains of those who checked the guest list on the night of Tatyana’s and Sergei’s fateful wedding, which ended in tragedy when Strahd became a vampire.</p><p>When characters enter this area, one of the skeleton guards produces a dusty ledger that carries the title <em><strong>Wedding Guests—Sergei von Zarovich &amp; Tatyana Federovna</strong></em>.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The guard runs its bony finger down a list of hundreds upon hundreds of names in fading ink. It looks up at you, cocking its skull questioningly. You gather that it is asking for your names.</p></aside><p>The characters are not on the list, obviously. However, the list is in poor condition and the minds of the skeletal guards are just as decayed as their flesh. They are merely going through the motions of their duties in life and are easy to fool. If the characters succeed on a DC 9 group Charisma (Deception) check, the guards salute and wave them inside; otherwise, they attack.</p><h3>K27. King’s Hall</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This twenty-foot-high hall has a dark, vaulted ceiling draped with cobwebs. A low moan seems to travel the length of the corridor as it rises and falls, intoning sadness and despair.</p></aside><p>The moaning is only the wind.</p><p>Characters who examine the ceiling can, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, spot pulleys and a rope that run the full length of the corridor along the ceiling, well hidden by the cobwebs. These items are explained in “Flight of the Vampire” below.</p><p>Halfway down the hall on the south side is a narrow secret door that can be pulled open to reveal area K31.</p><h4>Flight of the Vampire</h4><p>Hidden in a compartment above the western set of double doors is a dressed wooden mannequin that looks exactly like Strahd. It wears a black cloak, its fangs are bared, and its arms and clawed fingers are outstretched in a threatening manner. The mannequin is attached to a rope that runs through pulleys fastened along the length of the hallway ceiling.</p><p>When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the hall from either direction, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You hear a scraping sound of stone against stone, followed by the squeaking of a bat. In the direction of the noise, you see the fanged visage, outstretched claws, and flapping black cape of a vampire bearing down on you from above! A deep, throaty chuckle fills the hall.</p></aside><p>The scraping noise is the sound of the hidden compartment opening, and the squeaking is the sound of the pulleys supporting the weight of the mannequin as it glides through the air. The chuckling is a harmless magical effect similar to that created by a prestidigitation cantrip.</p><p>Have the players roll initiative, and run this as a combat encounter with the “vampire” acting on initiative count 5. On its turn, the mannequin flies over the characters, 10 feet above the floor, and doesn’t stop until it reaches the east end of the hall. On its next turn, it reverses direction and flies back to its compartment. The trap resets after 1 minute.</p><p>A character who attacks the mannequin from the floor needs a range of at least 10 feet. The mannequin has AC 15 and 10 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. If the mannequin is reduced to 0 hit points while in the air, it falls to the floor.</p><p>The vampire dummy here is actually a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.SIBlGKShJy73EqX2]{mimic}—Cyrus has developed a fondness for these creatures and keeps this one here just as the kettle mimic in area K65. This puppet mimic is dependent on the pulleys and ropes for movement while in its vampire dummy form. The pulleys have an AC of 20 and 10 hit points; if they are destroyed, the mimic falls to the ground. If any character approaches within five feet of the mimic at that point, it attacks.</p><p>The puppet mimic here uses the statistics of a standard mimic but has the following additional features:</p><p><strong>Scary Surprise</strong>. The mimic always gets a surprise round when initiative is rolled, unless a creature has a passive Perception of 20 or higher.</p><h3>K28. King’s Balcony</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A sculpted stone railing encloses this long balcony, which overlooks Ravenloft’s chapel. Two ornate thrones stand side by side in the center of the balcony, covered with dust and strung with cobwebs. The thrones face away from the double doors that give access to the balcony.</p></aside><p>Two Strahd zombies (see appendix D) are slouched on the thrones. They remain motionless until one of them is disturbed or another creature comes within a zombie’s reach, whereupon they attack.</p><p>The balcony is 50 feet above the floor of the chapel (area K15). A staircase north of the double doors leads down to area K29.</p><h3>K29. Creaky Landing</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This staircase is made of old wood that strains underfoot, creaking and groaning.</p></aside><p>The staircase climbs from area K16 to area K28. It seems unstable but is sturdy. The creatures in area K28 can’t be surprised by anyone climbing the creaky steps.</p><h3>K30. King’s Accountant</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dusty scrolls and tomes line the walls of this room. More scrolls and books lie scattered on the floor, around four heavy wooden chests fitted with study iron locks. The only unobstructed floor space is directly in front of the doors on the east and west walls.</p><p>In the center of this clutter stands a great black desk. A figure crouches atop a tall stool, scratching on a seemingly endless scroll of paper with a dry quill pen. Nearby a tasseled rope hangs from a hole in the ceiling.</p></aside><p>The figure is @UUID[Actor.2xTdI6a24ci92b8Q]{Lief Lipsiege} (CE male human commoner), an accountant. He is chained to the heavy wooden desk and has no interest in the characters or their concerns. Under no circumstances does he voluntarily leave the room. Lief pulls the rope the instant he feels threatened.</p><p>Pulling the rope requires an action. When the rope is pulled, a tremendously loud gong sounds. One or more creatures arrive 1d6 rounds later, attacking any characters still in the room.

He keeps all the books for Strahd, recording the vampire’s riches and conquests. Lief has been here longer than he can remember. He is grumpy because Strahd doesn’t allow him to know about all his treasures. Even so, Lief has found out where one of Strahd’s secret treasures lies. If he is treated with kindness, Lief will divulge the hiding place of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind (see appendix C), as indicated by your card reading. Lief can draw a crude map showing a route to that location. His map is geographically accurate, but he admits that it doesn’t acknowledge or avoid any dangers that might lie along the way. Lief doesn’t necessarily know the most direct path to the symbol’s location.</p><p>Lief knows that there’s a key that unlocks all four chests, but he can’t remember where he hid it. See “Treasure” below for more information.</p><p>The western door leads to area K25. The eastern door provides access to a staircase (area K21) that leads down to area K9 and up to a landing outside area K35, continuing upward from there to area K47.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>The room contains hundreds of worthless books and scrolls describing accounting procedures. The first character who spends at least 10 minutes searching the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a book with a bloodstained leather cover. The pages of this book have been hollowed out, creating a hole in which Lief has hidden the iron key that unlocks the four wooden chests in this room.</p><p>Two of the locked chests contain 10,000 cp each. A third chest contains 1,000 gp. The fourth chest holds 500 pp, hidden under which is a manual of bodily health.</p><h3>K31. Trapworks</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The aromas of grease and well-oiled wood hit your nostrils as you pull open the door. This ten-by-twenty-foot room is filled with intricate machinery, except for small spaces between the stone gears and the iron chains and pulleys. On the other side of the machinery, to the south, is a rectangular shaft that rises up from the darkness and continues past this room. Attached to the west wall is a steel plate that has an iron lever protruding downward.</p></aside><p>The shaft (area K31a) descends 90 feet from here to area K61, and ascends 40 feet to area K31b. Another 40 feet above that is a stone trapdoor in the ceiling that opens into area K47.</p><p>Operating the machinery in this room raises a stone elevator compartment from the bottom of the shaft, lifting it past this room to the top of the shaft. See area @UUID[.xcRPUsf02RAx7nv8#k61.-elevator-trap]{K61} for more information on the elevator trap.</p><p>A character can spend 1 minute disabling the machinery in this room. The elevator trap won’t function until the machinery is repaired.</p><p>The iron lever set into the western wall is normally in the “down” position. Moving it to the “up” position activates the trap and raises the elevator. Sliding it back down lowers the elevator and resets the trap.</p><p>When the elevator trap in area K61 is activated, all the chains, pulleys, and gears in this room move at once. It takes 10 seconds (1 round) for the elevator to reach the top of the shaft, and the machinery doesn’t stop until the elevator completes its journey.</p><p>A secret door in the north wall is easy to spot from this side (no ability check required) and opens into area K27.</p><h3>K31a. Elevator Shaft</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Cold air fills this rectangular shaft, the walls of which are coated with mildew and worn smooth. Taut iron chains extend up and down the shaft. The links of the chains are thick and covered with grease.</p></aside><p>The shaft is 170 feet tall. It starts at area K61, climbs 90 feet to area K31, another 40 feet to area K31b, and another 40 feet to area K47. When the elevator trap is activated (see area K61 for details), a stone elevator compartment measuring 10 feet on a side rises up the western half of the shaft. At the same time, a solid block of stone, also 10 feet on a side, descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. Both stone blocks have thick iron chains bolted to them, by which they are hoisted and lowered them as needed.</p><p>Scaling the shaft is impossible without the aid of magic or the use of a climber’s kit, because the walls are smooth and slick with mildew, and the greasy iron chains are too thick and slippery to grasp.</p><p>Set into the roof of the shaft is a 5-foot-square stone trapdoor that can be pushed open to reveal area K47.</p><h3>K31b. Shaft Access</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This ten-foot-square room overlooks a vertical shaft to the south that plunges into darkness and continues upward.</p></aside><p>This vantage point is 130 feet from the bottom of the shaft (area K31a). Forty feet down is area K31, and 40 feet up is a stone trapdoor in the ceiling that opens into area K47.</p><p>A door in the north wall is easy to spot from this side (no ability check required) and opens into area K39.</p><h3>K32. Maid in Hell</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Oil lamps illuminate this long, rectangular chamber with oak-paneled walls. Stained, yellowed lace hangs neatly from eight canopied beds. The figure of a woman moves lithely about the room, dusting furniture and humming quietly. Around her pale, slender neck is a gold necklace with a ruby pendant.</p></aside><p>The maid, @UUID[Actor.V3ZuHiQkJacoabxi]{Helga Ruvak}, is a vampire spawn who claims to be the daughter of the village bootmaker, kidnapped and forced into service by Strahd. She pleads, on her hands and knees if necessary, to be saved from this awful place.</p><p>Helga will join the party if the characters ask her along. She intends to attack the characters but does so only if she senses an opportunity that doesn’t involve having to fight the entire party. She also attacks if commanded to do so by Strahd.</p><p>Helga plays the part of the innocent damsel in distress to the last, revealing her ferocity only when she attacks. She is, in fact, the bootmaker’s daughter she claims to be, but she chose a life of evil with Strahd.</p><p>Helga is missing her ruby necklace, a gift given to her by Strahd when he mistook her for a reincarnation of Tatyana. Once he found out that Helga was not, in fact, a reincarnation of his lost love, Strahd took the necklace and gave it to Anastrasya. Helga has been furious ever since, and wants the necklace returned to her.</p><p>When she first encounters the characters, Helga pleads with the them to help her get the necklace back, claiming it to be a family heirloom. She knows where Anastrasya keeps it (in her crypt in area K84), and wants to see her dead. In all Helga does, she presents herself as an innocent human woman, wronged by Strahd and his minions.</p><p>Helga will still betray the characters if an opportunity to ingratiate herself with Strahd presents itself—she wants nothing more than to be in his good graces again. There is a chance the characters become wise to this with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check from how Helga tries to imitate the way Tatyana dressed and carried herself. This check can be made with advantage if they have seen the painting of Tatyana in area K37.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>Helga’s gold necklace with its ruby pendant is a gift from Strahd. The necklace is almost five centuries old and is worth 750 gp.</p><h3>K33. King’s Apartment Stair</h3><p>This dark hall is concealed behind two secret doors.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This arched corridor has been swept clean. Oak paneling decorates the walls to a height of four feet. Mounted on the east wall above the wood paneling are three unlit oil lamps spaced ten feet apart. A plain wooden door is set into the west wall, and light seeps through its cracks. A staircase at the north end of the west wall ascends into darkness.</p></aside><p>The staircase climbs 40 feet to area K45. The door in the west wall opens into area K32.</p><h3>K34. Servants’ Upper Floor (Tatyana's Quarters)</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dirt-caked windows allow little light to enter this upstairs room. Broken bed frames and torn bits of mattress litter the floors. A tall, dusty wardrobe roughly shaped like a coffin, its black doors painted with fey creatures, stands between two cracked, full-length mirrors hanging on the south wall. A staircase descends along the north wall.</p></aside><p>If someone opens the wardrobe, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A plain white dress yellowed with age flies out of the wardrobe and begins to dance in the middle of the room. The dress flaps around to the music of the storm.</p></aside><p>If anyone touches the dancing dress, it collapses in a lifeless heap on the floor. Otherwise, it dances forever. Hanging in the wardrobe are a few rotted servant’s uniforms, none of which are animate or valuable.</p><p>Set into the south wall, behind the hanging mirror west of the wardrobe, is a secret door. It can be pulled open to reveal a closet choked with dust and cobwebs and that contains a wooden ladder that leads up 20 feet to another secret door in the tower stairway (area K20).</p><p>The staircase leads down to area K24.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>This is where Tatyana lived for most of her stay at Castle Ravenloft. Being a peasant girl, it was not proper for her to stay in a nobler wing of the castle. However, Strahd wanted to keep her close and grant her a domain of her own, so this area was the perfect compromise to maintain the proper decorum.</p><p>Tatyana was playful and somewhat naive in life. She is responsible for the cavorting fey creatures painted on the doors of the wardrobe here. The dancing dress in this area was her favorite summer dress of hers and still remembers how she sashayed around in it. When the characters first encounter the dancing dress, they can hear a soft song being hummed by a beautiful clear voice:</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p>Sergei, my handsome—</p><p>Thrill me, darling,</p><p>With the words I want to hear—</p><p>Call me darling,</p><p>Call me sweetheart—</p><p>Call me, call me dear!</p></aside><p>The room is in chaos because Strahd smashed it in his fury when he realized that he had lost Tatyana forever. The only exception to the chaos is a single chair by a small nightstand with Tatyana’s diary in it. The diary can be located easily by anyone who looks in the nightstand.</p><p>Strahd comes here regularly to read and re-read the innocent account of the girl he fell in love with, writing in wonder of the noble world she has entered, full of love for Sergei and thankfulness to Strahd, as if to a benevolent uncle. Several of the pages that mention Sergei bear scratches, as if someone had clawed them in fury.</p><p>In the diary, Tatyana also mentions strange dreams of Strahd watching her from the corner of her room—she dismisses these as mere nightmares, but the diary entry provides enough clues for character to discover the secret door behind the hanging mirror without a check.</p><h4>A Dance of Death</h4><p>The dancing dress does not simply dance on forever, as written in the module. Rather, it continues its dance down the stairs and into area K24. The dress will then move into area K23 and outside to area K3 if the way is not blocked.</p><p>Once outside, the dress will cease its dance and begin to rush toward area K6, the overlook, as if it is being pursued by some unseen agitator. Once at the overlook, the dress floats up onto the railing and throw itself over the edge in an echo of Tatyana's demise hundreds of years prior.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Rooms of Weeping","type":"text","_id":"cpfE4WX83bagJvy8","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Refer to map 5 of the castle for areas K35 through K46.</p><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/maps/Curse%20of%20Strahd/Castle%20Ravenloft/standard/cos-008.jpg\" /><h3>K35. Guardian Vermin</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A door of delicately engraved steel stands at the west end of this short, dark hallway.

These rats are under Strahd’s control and attack anyone that tries to move through this area.</p><p>The steel door is engraved with images of a human king in armor astride a horse, a majestic range of mountains and shooting stars in the background. Tiny figures of people and wolves frame the image.</p><h3>K36. Dining Hall of the Count</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dust assaults your lungs. A sweet yet pungent smell of decay fills this room, in the center of which stands a long oak table. A blanket of dust covers the tabletop and its fine china and silverware. In the center of the table, a large, tiered cake leans heavily to one side. The once white frosting has turned green with age. Cobwebs hang like dusty lace down every side of the cake. A single doll figure of a well-dressed woman adorns the crest of the cake. Suspended above is a web-shrouded chandelier of forged iron. An arched window in the south wall is draped with heavy curtains. Resting in a wooden stand by the window is a dusty lute, and standing quietly in the southwest corner is a tall harp shrouded in cobwebs.</p></aside><p>The wedding cake is over four centuries old, kept in its current rotten state by the will of Strahd. The toy figure of the groom from the top of the cake was cast on the floor long ago. A character who searches the dusty floor finds the figurine with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><p>If the characters take the groom figurine out of the room, read the following if they return to the room at a later time:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Billowing drapes draw your eye to the window, which has been broken outward.

Instead, the party encounters a crypt chanter (see Appendix B) who is playing the harp in the southwest corner.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The faint notes of a hauntingly beautiful music, sadly recalling happier times, hang in the cold air. You become aware of a ghostly woman dressed in the finery of a court musician, sitting at the harp in the southwest corner of the room. She softly strums her eerie melody, swaying gently to the tune, her eyes hooded by eternal grief.</p></aside><p>The crypt chanter is mad with loneliness and grief. She yearns for the rapt and joyful audience she once had in life. Once the party enters the room, the crypt chanter tries to catch their attention with its song, and modulates the melody if it does not receive attention.</p><p>While the crypt chanter does not initiate combat upon seeing the party, she will immediately user her song of sorrow ability to charm any character within 60 feet of her. If the party seems to be moving on to another room, the crypt chanter grows hostile and makes clear attempts to engage with the party, playing different melodies that grow angrier and more discordant the further they move towards an exit.</p><p>The party can appease the crypt chanter by joining her song of sorrow with any sort of instrument or song available to them and succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. On a failure, the crypt chanter becomes hostile and attacks until defeated.</p><p><s>The harp stands 6½ feet tall, weighs close to 300 pounds, and is fashioned of dark, stained wood carved with images of harts and roses.

He asks, “Why have you summoned me from beyond the grave?” Regardless of the answer, he commends the character for playing well and says, “In my crypt below the castle, thou shalt find a treasure worthy of one so talented as thee! May it help thee set this troubled place to rest.” If the characters think to ask him who he is, the fool replies, “Pidlwick.” If asked how he died, he replies humorlessly, “I fell down the stairs.” If Pidlwick II (see area K59) is with the party, the ghost points at the clockwork effigy and says, “He pushed me down the stairs.”</s></p><p><s>With nothing more to add, the ghost of Pidlwick fades away and doesn’t appear again.

Study</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A blazing hearth fire fills this room with rolling waves of red and amber light. The walls are lined with ancient books and tomes, their leather covers well oiled and preserved through careful use. All is in order here. The stone floor is concealed beneath a thick, luxurious rug. In the center of the room is a large, low table, waxed and polished to a mirrored finish. Even the poker in its stand next to the blazing fireplace is polished. Large, overstuffed divans and couches are arranged about the room. Two chairs of burgundy-colored wood with padded leather seats and back cushions face the hearth. A huge painting hangs over the mantelpiece in a heavy, gilded frame. The rolling firelight illuminates the carefully rendered portrait. It is an exact likeness of Ireena Kolyana.</p></aside><p>This chamber has several exits, including a large set of double doors in the west wall, a door at each end of the north wall, and a door to the south.</p><p>The painting above the fireplace depicts Tatyana, a beautiful young woman with auburn hair. Strahd commissioned the painting over four centuries ago to impress his beloved. The fact that Ireena Kolyana looks exactly like Tatyana is proof to Strahd that both women were born with the same soul.</p><p>The back wall of the fireplace contains a secret door, which is opened by lifting the poker from its stand. The fire must be extinguished in order for anyone to reach the secret door safely. Otherwise, a creature that enters the fireplace for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire. Until someone takes an action to douse the flames on the creature, it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. (This fire damage is cumulative with the damage from standing in the fireplace.)</p><p>The secret door provides access to area K38.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>The real treasure here is Strahd’s collection of books—over one thousand unique tomes in all. The collection is worth 80,000 gp. Transporting it would be a challenge.</p><p>Roll a d12 and consult the following table to determine the subject matter of a randomly chosen book.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.rolltables.xBmA3FRUfyx3Dprl]{Book}</p><h4>Teleport Destination</h4><p>Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive in front of the painting of Tatyana.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is resting on the mantelpiece under the portrait of Tatyana.</p><p>If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is sitting back in one of the overstuffed chairs, staring into the fire.</p><h3>K38. False Treasury</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Resting on the floor of this smoke-filled room is a closed chest surrounded by piles of gold, silver, and copper coins. The fittings and clawed feet on the chest are evidence of great workmanship.</p><p>Attached to the east wall are two torch sconces. The southernmost one holds a torch with an intricate metal base. The other is empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor lies against the wall. The skeleton’s right hand is on its throat, and its left hand holds the matching torch from the empty sconce.</p></aside><p>The coins scattered around the trapped chest total 50 gp, 100 sp, and 2,000 cp. The chest weighs 40 pounds and is unlocked. When opened, it releases a cloud of sleeping gas that fills the room. Any creature in the room must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 4 hours. If all the characters succumb to the gas, they are found by the witches who lair in area K56 and dragged to area K50, then left there unharmed. If even one character resists the effect of the gas, the witches do not appear.</p><p>The armored skeleton on the floor is all that remains of an adventurer. His corpse has nothing of value.</p><h4>Secret Doors</h4><p>This room is concealed behind two secret doors.</p><p>The secret door to the west is set into the back wall of the fireplace (area K37) and can be pulled open from within this room by lifting a simple locking mechanism (which is connected to the poker in the study). It’s possible that a character might open this secret door inadvertently by lifting the poker in area K37. Characters can otherwise locate the secret door normally, but a successful check doesn’t reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a knock spell or similar magic.</p><p>The secret door at the northern end of the east wall is sealed shut. If the torch is taken from the skeleton’s hand and placed back in the empty sconce, the secret door swings inward, revealing area K39 beyond. Removing the torch from its sconce at any time causes the secret door to close and lock shut, becoming sealed as before. Characters can locate this secret door normally, but a successful check doesn’t reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a knock spell or similar magic.</p><h3>K39. Hall of Webs</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This ancient hall is choked with spider webs broken by a single clear path down its center.</p></aside><p>The hall has an arched ceiling 20 feet overhead, hidden behind thick webbing. At the eastern end are a pair of arched bronze doors of ornate design. These doors can be pulled open to reveal area K40 beyond.</p><p>Most of the hall is full of giant spider webs (see “Dungeon Hazards” in chapter 5, “Adventure Environments,” of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Characters who stray from the unobstructed path through the webs risk becoming stuck.</p><h4>Secret Doors</h4><p>At the west end of the hall are two secret doors.</p><p>The secret door on the west wall can’t be opened from this side, except by magic (such as a knock spell). See area K38 for more information on this secret door. If the characters pass through this door coming from area K38, it closes and locks behind them if they don’t take measures to prop it open.</p><p>A narrow secret door at the western end of the south wall is hidden behind a mass of webs. If these webs are cleared away, characters can search for the secret door, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The door can be pulled open to reveal area K31b.</p><h3>K40. Belfry</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You can hear the rain and thunder outside, and the air here is cold and damp. Veils and curtains of webbing fill the room, making it hard to gauge its width and depth. A single, narrow path leads to the dark center of the room, where a rope dangles from high above.</p></aside><p>The rope is attached to a great bell mounted in a wooden framework 50 feet overhead. Pulling the rope or attempting to climb it brings forth a loud, long “GONG.” That sound causes five giant spiders to drop from their webs and attack. The spiders attack only if they are attacked or if the bell is sounded.</p><p>Most of the belfry is filled with giant spider webs (see “Dungeon Hazards” in chapter 5, “Adventure Environments,” of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Characters who blunder into them risk becoming stuck.</p><p>At the west end of the north wall, behind thick webs, is a secret door that opens into area K41.</p><h3>K41. Treasury</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This octagonal vault is free of dust and cobwebs. The domed ceiling forty feet above is painted black and sparkles with a display of stars in unfamiliar constellations. Barely contained within this vault is a square tower, twenty feet on a side and thirty feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlemented roof.</p></aside><p>The domed ceiling is coated with dry pitch. The “stars” are shards of glowing crystal embedded in the pitch, each one as bright as a candle flame. Thanks to the starry “night sky,” the vault is dimly lit.</p><p>The plundered riches of Strahd’s secret hoard lie within this adamantine tower, <s>which is actually a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-6-items.CkTaVhsDN6gLBdDC]{Daern’s instant fortress} (see chapter 7, “Treasure,” of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Only Strahd knows the command word to alter its shape and size, which can’t be done until every bit of treasure inside it is removed. Only Strahd can open the two means of entry: a sealed adamantine door set into the base of the tower on the north side, and an adamantine trapdoor on the roof.</s></p><p>The arrow slits of the tower are 4 inches wide and 2 feet tall, and the walls of the fortress are 3 inches thick. Characters who are able to reduce their size or assume gaseous form can enter the tower through these slits.</p><p>Rather than a Daerne’s Instant Fortress, this area is a normal part of Castle Ravenloft. The entrance is thoroughly trapped, however. Rather than a normal door, the treasury is guarded by a <strong>Door of Faces</strong>, a complex trap crafted by Strahd himself. He created the door from several victims whom he had caught trying to steal from the castle.</p><p>When inactive, the door appears to be made of iron, but with an irregular surface texture. Close inspection reveals what appear to be faces with closed eyes and mouths embossed on the door. When the door’s trap is triggered, however, the iron melts away and the faces underneath become animated. They begin to twist and contort, leering and shouting at nearby characters.</p><p>Attempting to open the door, whether by mundane or magical means, triggers the trap. Once a character starts to interfere with the lock, have everyone roll initiative. Run the trap like you would a legendary creature in combat, triggering its various elements as the party’s efforts to bypass the trap unfold (see the Door of Faces sidebar).</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>DOOR OF FACES</strong></p><p><em>Complex trap</em></p><p><strong>Trigger</strong>. This trap activates as soon as someone attempts to open the door, whether by mundane or magical means, and acts on initiative counts 10 and 20. It reverts back to its inert form if there is no creature within 30 feet of it on one of its turns.</p><h4>Actions</h4><p><strong>Domineering Look</strong>. The eyes of all faces all roll in unison to look one particular creature in the eye, piercing its very soul. The door casts dominate person on the target (spell save DC 16). The door can concentrate on only one dominate person spell at a time.</p><p><strong>Mockery</strong>. The voices unify to mock one particular creature within 60 feet of it and casts vicious mockery on it (spell save DC 16).</p><h4>Reactions</h4><p><strong>Taunt</strong>. As a reaction, the door shouts distracting abuse at the character and it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. The door can take this reaction twice per round.</p><h4>Constant Elements</h4><p><strong>Maddening Glares</strong>. Characters who starts its turn within 30 feet of the door or who enter the area for the first time on one of their turns must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of a confusion spell for that turn. Characters who succeed on this save are immune against this effect for 24 hours.</p><h4>Countermeasures</h4><p>If both its voice and its sight are disabled, the door can be passed safely like a normal door.</p><p><strong>Muting the Voices</strong>. If the door is made mute in some way, it loses all effects that rely on its voice. The character with the highest passive Investigation score notices that one of the mouths is gagged with an old rag and is furiously working to spit it out, in vain. If all other mouths are gagged or a silence spell is cast on the door, it loses its voice. Gagging a mouth requires an action and being within 5 feet of the door. There are six mouths to gag.</p><p><strong>Blinding the Eyes</strong>. If the door is made blind in some way, it loses all effects that rely on its voice. The eyes have darkvision out to a range of 30 feet, but cannot see through magical darkness, so a darkness spell would disrupt its sight. A blindness/deafness spell or a color spray spell could achieve the same, but the door can resist with a +8 bonus to its saving throw, as if it were a creature saving from it. Alternatively, the eyes can be poked out one by one, blinding the door. This requires a successful attack against AC 18. There are six pairs of eyes to blind and they can be blinded one pair at a time.</p></aside><p>Once the Door of Faces is overcome, possibly by disabling its two main ways of harassing characters, it functions just like a mundane door. The faces hang slack and revert back to their iron form. If a temporary effect that disabled the door is removed, the door becomes active once more.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>The ground floor of the Daern’s instant fortress contains 50,000 cp, 10,000 sp, 10,000 gp, 1,000 pp, 15 assorted gems (100 gp each), and a +2 shield emblazoned with a stylized silver dragon that is the emblem of the Order of the Silver Dragon (see chapter 7). The shield whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn’t incapacitated.</p><p>The upper floor of the tower contains 10 pieces of jewelry (250 gp each) in a red velvet sack, an alchemy jug, a helm of brilliance, a rod of the pact keeper, +1, and an unlocked wooden coffer with four compartments, each one containing a potion of greater healing.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying atop the coins on the ground floor inside the tower.</p><p>If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is perched atop the tower.</p><h3>K42. King’s Bedchamber</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Sweet smells waft from this delicately lit room. A great arched window along the west wall is covered by heavy red draperies, their golden tassels glinting in the light of three candelabras sitting atop small tables about the room. Tall white candles burn with bright, steady light.</p><p>A large bed, canopied by silk curtains, sits with its headboard against the north wall. Carved into the headboard with great skill is a large “Z.” Lying amid the velvet and satin sheets and bedclothes is a young woman in a nightgown. One of her dainty slippers has fallen to the floor at the bed’s foot.</p></aside><p>Arched double doors lead from this room to the south and east.</p><p>The window is divided into four tall panes of glass, each enclosed by a lead framework. The two outermost sections have small iron hinges built into them so that they can be opened, as well as iron latches to lock them in place when they’re closed. The window looks out onto the parapet (area K46).</p><p>The figure on the bed is @UUID[Actor.ZNfHuMvCfn1VZEcw]{Gertruda }(NG female human commoner), the daughter of Mad Mary (see chapter 3, area E3). Gertruda is oblivious to any danger to herself—especially from Strahd, who has charmed her. Sheltered by her mother, she was never allowed to leave home as a child. She finally slipped away and made her way to the castle, drawn by its majesty.</p><p>Gertruda is innocent, and years spent as a shut-in have twisted her sense of reality. Consequently, she maintains a fairy-tale view of life. When faced with a decision, she almost always makes the most simplistic choice. She is naive to the point of being a danger to herself and others. Fortunately for her, Strahd has not yet bitten her, though he intends to. (If he can do so while the characters look on helplessly, so much the better.)</p><p>Next to the bed, set into the north wall, is a secret door. It can be pushed open to reveal a dusty hall that ends at a similar secret door in the back of an alcove (see area K45 for details). Gertruda doesn’t know that this secret door exists.</p><h3>K43. Bath Chamber</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Red satin curtains hang in archways at both ends of the south wall in this dark room. Between them, in the center of the chamber, stands a large, ornate iron tub with clawed feet. The tub is full of blood.</p></aside><p>Both curtained archways lead to area K44.</p><h4>Tormented Spirit</h4><p>The spirit of Varushka, a maid, haunts this chamber. She took her own life when Strahd began feeding on her, denying him the chance to turn her into a vampire spawn.</p><p><s>The blood in the tub isn’t real, but rather a manifestation of Varushka’s tormented spirit. If the blood is disturbed in any way, read:</s></p><p><s>A blood-drenched creature explodes out of the tub and attaches to the ceiling, cackling maniacally. Blood pours off its pale flesh, bony limbs, and stringy hair as it scuttles away.</s></p><p><s>The creature that erupts from the tub is no more real than the blood. It can’t be harmed and doesn’t attack. It scuttles across the ceiling, disappearing into area K44 through one of the archways. Once there, it disappears.</s></p><p>The spirit of Varushka, the maid that took her own life here rather than become a vampire spawn of Strahd’s, still haunts this area—but takes on a far more active and vengeful role. She has been mocking and tormenting poor Gertruda with surprise scares, and worse, ever since Gertruda arrived. Varushka does not want anyone to fall for Strahd and feels for his other victims, but has little patience for fools who would give themselves to him willingly. She also holds a dim view of anyone who thinks they can best Strahd—she has seen too many come and die at his hand over the centuries.</p><p>Varushka follows anyone around who falls in either of the two categories, as long as they are in the Rooms of Weeping, and periodically haunts them (see Bloody Bath Haunt table). She can only be appeased by showing her one of the Fortunes of Ravenloft items and succeeding in a DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check while characters explain that they can, in fact, defeat Strahd (one attempt per item, only one success necessary).</p><p>Bloody Bath Haunt Table</p><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Bloody Haunt</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Bloody Footprints</strong>. The characters come across bloody footprints, that lead away from them and towards the closest exit, appearing before their very eyes. They stop after a few paces and then vanish.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Echoing Voices</strong>. Varushka speaks to the characters as an echoing voice, but only in short phrases, such as “turn back, you fools—save yourselves” or “you were not the first—do you think you’ll be the last?” or “he is too powerful for you.”</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Cold Hands</strong>. Varushka touches one of the characters, sending a cold shiver down their spine as if ice water was poured down their back. They must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or also be poisoned for 10 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Possession</strong>. Varushka possesses one of the characters, as a ghost would. She mocks the other party members and berates them for their futile foolishness. She explains her own history and explains that she thinks their quest is not only futile, but foolish. She can be reasoned with and invited to possess someone else to talk with her after this occurs for the first time. If nobody engages her, she departs the host after a few minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Poltergeist</strong>. Varushka pushes or pulls a character unexpectedly, knocking them prone or smashing them into a wall or furniture. A character she attacks in this way must succeed in a DC 13 Strength saving throw (with disadvantage, due to the unexpected attack) or also take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from this.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Attack</strong>. Varushka manifests as a ghost with the Telekinetic Thrust ability of a poltergeist and attacks the group. She does not fight to the death, and rather fades into a wall after she did some damage in a surprise round. Her objective is to turn these fools back, not kill them.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>K44. Closet</h2><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The walls here are lined with iron hooks, upon which hang black capes and formal wear. Two arched windows in the south wall are covered by heavy curtains.</p></aside><p>Twenty-eight capes and sixteen sets of fine clothes are stored here. Red satin drapes hang in the archways that connect this closet to the adjoining bath chamber (area K43).</p><p>The clothes here are intended by Strahd for Tatyana’s use—and her use only. The garments are enchanted to reveal anyone who removes them without Strahd’s authorization. The trespasser’s right hand grows black, starting from the fingertips, over a period of 24 hours after removing a garment from the closet. This recalls the traditional Barovian punishment for thieves—chopping off of the right hand. Once the entire hand has grown black, it falls off and becomes a crawling claw that is friendly towards its erstwhile owner. This effect can be reversed, over the course of another 24 hours, including reattaching the hand, by a remove curse or greater restoration spell.</p><p>Gertruda has been longing after these garments ever since she moved into Castle Ravenloft, but Strahd has forbidden her to touch any of them. In her childlike naivete, she could not contain herself, however. Her fingers are already black to her knuckles, which she tries to conceal, but characters with a passive Perception of 13 or higher can notice.</p><h3>K45. Hall of Heroes</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dark alcoves line the walls of this long hall. The ceiling has fallen here, leaving rubble strewn across the floor. Overhead, the beams of Ravenloft’s roof are exposed. Lightning from the dark clouds above sporadically illuminates the hall, lighting the faces of life-sized human statues in the alcoves. Each visage is frozen in terror.</p></aside><p>The ten statues that line this corridor depict ancient heroes. In actuality, the faces of the statues are stoic and expressionless, but whenever the lightning flashes, their expressions change to utter horror until the hall goes dark again.</p><p>The characters have another opportunity to have some of their questions divined by the ghosts of the fallen adventurers that came before them, in area K67. The statues in this area instead address the characters directly, turning their heads towards them as they pass. They mutter cryptic observations about the characters’ past and make vague prophecies about their future. Some of these are outrageous, some eerily plausible—but none of them are true, except by accident. Each statue makes no more than one single statement as the group passes them; they do not answer any questions.</p><p>The stairs at the west end of the hall descend 40 feet to area K33. An open archway to the east reveals a tower landing beyond (part of area K20).</p><h3>K46. Parapets</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You stand on a ten-foot-wide walkway that encircles most of the keep. The drizzle of rain continues, punctuated by the occasional clap of thunder or stroke of lightning. Far below these parapets are the shining wet cobblestones of the courtyard.</p></aside><p>The walkway runs around the front of the upper portion of the keep. Battlemented walkways extend from the keep north, south, and east to the outer walls of the castle as well. (See map 2 for the length and location of the castle walls.) All the windows leading from this area into the keep are shut and locked, but can easily be broken.</p><p>If the characters loiter on the parapets or atop the castle walls for more than 5 minutes, they encounter @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.RKQiSUYHYiZ2vuzK]{Strahd’s animated armor} (see appendix D) making the rounds. It patrols the parapets and the outer walls of Ravenloft day and night. Under a darkened sky, characters without darkvision are more likely to hear the clatter of the armor approaching before they can see it.</p><p>The armor can’t be salvaged if it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Spires of Ravenloft","type":"text","_id":"dHNDr99FtNkL3CBa","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Refer to maps 6 through 10 of Castle Ravenloft for areas K47 through K60.</p><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/maps/Curse%20of%20Strahd/Castle%20Ravenloft/standard/cos-009.jpg\" /><h3>K47. Portrait of Strahd</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.</p><p>An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet penetrating gaze.</p></aside><p>The ornate rug is actually a @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.Kz6X6b4yrhKyOZgY]{rug of smothering}. It attacks creatures, other than undead, that move across it or anyone who tries to move it or otherwise disturb it. Underneath the rug is a bare stone floor.</p><p>The rug of smothering in this area does not immediately attack the first character to step on it. As a relatively weak combatant, its primary goal is smother its opponent and cause them to fall down the nearby staircase. To that end, it will wait patiently until there is a clear path to the staircase before attacking.</p><p>Any creature that the rug pushes down the stairs takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet of falling. Every 10 feet, the character may make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw check to stop the fall. On a failure, they fall another 10 feet.</p><p>The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on a side and as thick as the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring built into the side opposite the hinges. Pulling up on the ring opens the door. Below the trapdoor, characters see one of two things: either a 170-foot-deep shaft (area K31a) or, if the elevator trap has been activated (see area K61), a stone elevator compartment with a secret hatch in its top.</p><p>The portrait on the wall depicts Strahd von Zarovich before he became a vampire. Even in life, he was pale. The eyes of the portrait seem to watch and follow the characters as they explore the area. The picture frame is bolted to the wall and can’t be removed without destroying it.</p><p>If the characters attack the rug or the picture, or if they attempt to remove either item, the @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.bzxuTVpVBwEozKOW]{guardian portrait} attacks.</p><p>At your discretion, the guardian portrait here may remain a non-combatant. Instead, Strahd may use it as a means of surveillance as he magically looks through the eyes of the painting. With a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, characters notice the eyes of the painting move as they look around the area.</p><h3>K48. Offstair</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This spiraling staircase is dark and dusty.</p></aside><p>This stairway rises from area K47, past area K54, to area K57.</p><h3>K49. Lounge</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>As thunder shakes the tower, heavy beams groan under the weight of the ceiling. Three ornate lanterns hang by chains from these beams, each casting a dim glow. The curved west wall is fitted with three windows of leaded glass in steel latticework. A bookcase sits on the east wall between two doors. Plush, overstuffed chairs and couches are placed about the room. The fabric has faded with age, and the patterns it depicts are nearly gone. Lounging on one couch is a handsome young man whose attire, while elegant, is worn and faded.</p></aside><p>The youthful man on the couch is Escher, a dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in the past. Prior to becoming one of Strahd’s consorts, Escher was an adventurer trapped in Barovia, just like the characters. If the characters have not met Escher before, he is unaware of their exploits as he has fallen from Strahd’s grace and is not kept apprised of goings-on outside of the castle.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>ESCHER - Lunch Break Heroes</strong></p><p>Escher is not immediately hostile when encountering the characters. Although he is reluctant to talk with them at first, he can be convinced to open up with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the characters convince Escher that they share with him the common goal of escaping Barovia, and that they have a fighting chance to do so, he offers to aid them in whatever small ways that he can. Escher is incapable of physically acting against Strahd due to the nature of their ties, but he can provide characters with information about the castle and Strahd’s tactics.</p><p>If there are any Fortunes of Ravenloft items inside the castle, Escher knows where they are and can tell the characters where they are.</p></aside><p>The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn’t allow for much of a view.</p><p>Should any character look out the window in this area, they see that a number of grotesque statues of winged beasts are set along the rooftop edge at irregular intervals. Any character with a passive Perception of 16 or higher catches one of these gargoyles moving. See area K53 for more details.</p><p>If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there’s a 50 percent chance that a vampire spawn crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.</p><p>The books in the bookcase have no value and aren’t much help to the characters. Some of the titles found on the bookshelf include <em><strong>Embalming: The Lost Art</strong></em>, <em><strong>Life Among the Undead: Learning to Cope</strong></em>, <em><strong>Castle Building 101</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Goats of the Balinok Mountains</strong></em>.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a platinum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns (worth 150 gp). Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pendant (worth 750 gp).</p><h3>K50. Guest Room</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A large bed sits in the center of this room, its four corner posts supporting a black canopy trimmed with gold tassels. Several comfortable divans are placed about the room. There is a banded door in the west wall and a smaller unbanded door in the east wall.</p></aside><p>There is no danger in this area during the day. But if the characters try to take a short rest here during the night, the rest is interrupted by the arrival of 1d4 @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.8bDfTMyJy7UiAfwL]{Barovian witches} from area K56. They try to subdue the party with sleep spells. A witch retreats to area K56 if wounded.</p><h3>K51. Closet</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This small, wood-paneled room reeks of mildew and has a ten-foot-high ceiling. Iron hooks line the walls, and a dusty black cloak hangs from one hook in the center of the south wall.</p></aside><p>The cloak is ordinary. The witches in area K56 placed it here to help them remember which hook opens the secret trapdoor in the ceiling.</p><p>The trapdoor can be found after a search of the room and a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Locating the trapdoor doesn’t enable someone to discover its opening mechanism. The door has a hidden lock and can be opened by pulling down on the hook from which the black cloak hangs. Once it has been found, the trapdoor can be opened by pulling on the hook, or it can be unlocked by someone using thieves’ tools, a knock spell, or similar magic. It swings down when unlocked.</p><h3>K52. Smokestack</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Jutting from the steeply sloping rooftop of the castle, a spindly smokestack, five feet in diameter at the top, rises thirty feet above the roof’s peak. Smoke belches from its iron-pronged capstone.</p></aside><p>The chimney leads down 60 feet to the blazing fireplace in area K37. A creature that starts its turn in the chimney takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.</p><p>Any characters that come close to this smokestack while moving on the rooftop, or who attempt to enter it, are attacked by 1d4 @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.0uH3DITgDFUz2ydD]{smoke mephits}. The mephits fight until defeated. Noise from this encounter alerts the gargoyles in area K53, who come to join the fray after three rounds.</p><h3>K53. Rooftop</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Rain splashes against the sagging, sloping rooftop. Flashes of lightning illuminate gargoyles perched on the roof’s end peaks, their hideous stares forever fixed on the courtyard some one hundred thirty feet below.</p></aside><p>If a character tries to traverse the rooftop, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Some of the ancient roof tiles slide easily underfoot, easily dropping into the fog-shrouded darkness. Each falling tile resounds with a hollow click as it hits the flagstones of the parapet or courtyard below.</p></aside><p>A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to traverse the roof. The check succeeds automatically if the character crawls. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character slides off the edge of the roof and falls 40 feet to the castle parapet (area K46).</p><p>If any characters move across the rooftop, they are attacked by 1d4 + 2 @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.QjFYMPba7kSzF5Vo]{gargoyles} set along the edges; the rest remain inert but can animate at any time. There seems to be an almost inexhaustible supply. Over time, new gargoyles eerily take the place of those vanquished while nobody is looking.</p><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/maps/Curse%20of%20Strahd/Castle%20Ravenloft/standard/cos-010.jpg\" /><h3>K54. Familiar Room</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The low ceiling of this twenty-foot-square room presses down on you. Torn and broken couches lie in heaps, haphazardly strewn about. Deep claw marks cover the hardwood furniture, and the once lush upholstery has been sliced to shreds. From the dark shadows amid the rubble, three pairs of green eyes stare back at you.</p></aside><p>The three @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.Jiw4VmYQDAaWu8Mz]{cats} are familiars of the witches in area K56. If the familiars see the characters here, the witches are alerted to their presence.</p><h3>K55. Element Room</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Heavy beams support the ceiling of this large room, the outer wall of which curves to follow the shape of the tower. Dim light filters into the room through the steel lattice squares of two leaded glass windows. Several tables stand throughout the room, weighed down by stacks of glass jars and bottles, all of them bearing labels.</p></aside><p>The labeled glass containers hold various elements that the witches use in their fell concoctions and rituals. The labels identify such items as “Eye of Newt,” “Hair of Bat,” “Snail Hearts,” and “Frog’s Breath.” There are no magic potions among the bottles and jars.</p><p>The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They are currently locked from the inside. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there’s a 50 percent chance that a @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.v1xFGVuVvCzSfmsw]{vampire spawn} crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.</p><p>Characters who search the room spot numerous boot prints in the dust, as well as a short trail in the dust on the floor, leading from the northeast corner of the room to the easternmost door. It looks like something heavy was dragged across the floor toward the doorway.</p><p>There is a secret trapdoor in the northeast corner of the floor. Because of the trail through the dust, the trapdoor can be found without an ability check. Tapping or knocking on the trapdoor three times releases a hidden latch, causing the trapdoor to swing down. Area K51 lies below. (There’s no ability check that will let the characters figure out the trick to opening the door. They can get that information from the witches, or perhaps by using a divination spell or similar magic.)</p><h3>K56. Cauldron</h3><p>Characters who stand outside the door to this room can smell a pungent odor coming from within.</p><p>If the witches in this room have not been warned that the characters are coming, the characters can hear their horrid cackling. If the characters open the door slightly, they witness the scene described below:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppressive room. Surrounding the cauldron are several gaunt women in soiled black robes. These witches sit hunched on tall wooden stools, their tangled hair tucked under black, pointed hats. They take turns tossing ingredients into the cauldron, uttering fell incantations, and cackling maniacally.</p></aside><p>If the witches know the characters are coming, read the following text instead:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppressive room. Surrounding the cauldron are seven tall wooden stools.</p></aside><p>The @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.8bDfTMyJy7UiAfwL]{Barovian witches} that dwell in this area have sworn themselves to Strahd’s service in exchange for arcane power. Seven witches are present when the characters arrive, minus any that might have been encountered and defeated in area K50. If the witches are expecting the characters, they cast invisibility spells and stand quietly in the corners of the room, hoping that the cauldron draws their prey inside. Although they prefer to attack at range with their spells, they can grow magic claws using alter self.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p>The seven witches of the coven introduce themselves by name, if given the chance: Circe, Corvus, Cindy, Cassandra, Clarabelle, Craven, and Crecia. Corvus is their leader, and is in possession of a flying broom.</p></aside><p>When the cauldron is touched by someone who also speaks the proper command word (“Gorah!”), it magically heats any liquid placed inside it and remains hot for 3 hours, or until the command word is spoken again by someone within 5 feet of the cauldron. Once the cauldron’s property has been used, the cauldron can’t be activated again until the next dawn.</p><p>Captured witches will trade information in exchange for their lives and freedom, and can be forced to divulge the command word for activating and deactivating the cauldron. They also know how to open the trapdoor in area K55.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>Each witch carries a potion of healing that she made herself. There is a 30 percent chance that a potion has “gone bad,” in which case it’s actually a potion of poison.</p><p>Not visible from the entrance is a small table behind the cauldron on which sits an opened spellbook, seemingly on the verge of falling apart. The book is evil. Any non-evil creature that touches it or starts its turn with the book in its possession takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. The book contains the following spells:</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p>1st level: burning hands, charm person, detect magic, find familiar, fog cloud, mage armor, protection from evil and good, ray of sickness, sleep, Tasha’s hideous laughter, unseen servant, witch bolt</p><p>2nd level: alter self, arcane lock, cloud of daggers, darkness, enlarge/reduce, invisibility, knock, misty step</p></aside><h3>K57. Tower Roof</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The sixty-foot-diameter tower roof is rimmed with battlements. A slender stone bridge with no railing spans the gap between this tower and the slightly taller tower to the north. To the east, the high tower of Ravenloft thrusts skyward with no apparent opening at this level. Black, boiling clouds hurl rain down from above.</p></aside><p>The courtyard is 190 feet below, the roof of the keep 80 feet below. A stone railing encloses a stone spiral staircase that descends into the tower.</p><p>One particularly stocky @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.QjFYMPba7kSzF5Vo]{gargoyle} perches here. It has 77 hit points and its attacks deal 1d8+2 damage.</p><h3>K58. Bridge</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A strong wind blows across this slender bridge of stone and masonry. The bridge’s old iron railings have rusted away years ago, leaving the bridge without handholds.</p></aside><p>The bridge connects areas K20 and K57. The wind isn’t strong enough to knock creatures off the bridge, but a creature that takes damage while standing on the bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 60 feet onto the roof of the keep.</p><p>If the characters try to traverse this bridge, 1d4 + 2 @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.QjFYMPba7kSzF5Vo]{gargoyles} attack when they are right in the middle of their crossing. The gargoyles attempt to push or drag the characters off the bridge.</p><h3>K59. High Tower Peak</h3><p>If the characters climb the stairs to reach the tower peak, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The spiral staircase finally ends at a five-foot-wide stone walkway that circles the shaft. In the center of the tower’s highest floor, a fifteen-foot-diameter hole drops into the cold heart of Ravenloft itself. Cold air rushes up out of the shaft, sending a chill through you. Arrow slits line the walls, and aging beams support a steep, cone-shaped roof. One beam and part of the roof have fallen away, leaving a gaping hole open to the stormy sky.</p></aside><p>The hole in the floor forms the mouth of an enclosed shaft (area K18a) that descends 450 feet to the castle catacombs (area K84).</p><h4>Pidlwick II</h4><p>Hiding in the rafters is @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.4rgfia9z8FLTlvuY]{Pidlwick II}. A character spots Pidlwick II with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score that meets or exceeds its Dexterity (Stealth) check. If Pidlwick II is spotted, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Something lurks among the rafters—a small, spindly man not much larger than a child. A flash of lightning illuminates his face, which is painted like a grinning jack-o’-lantern.</p></aside><p>Although he appears to be a petite man wearing face paint and a fool’s costume, Pidlwick II is actually a clockwork effigy of the real-life Pidlwick, who lies entombed in the catacombs. The dark paint on his face is soot.</p><p>If the characters see Pidlwick II in bright light, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>It’s obvious that you’re looking not at a small man, but a mockery of one. This thing is not a creature of flesh and bone, but a construct made of dyed leather stitched and tightly wrapped over an articulated frame. You hear the soft tumbling and clicking of gears.</p></aside><p>Pidlwick II can’t speak and doesn’t have an expressive face, so he relies mostly on hand gestures and simple diagrams to communicate. He understands Common but can’t read or write.</p><p>If the characters show kindness to the clockwork effigy, it accompanies them and tries its best to be helpful and entertaining. It knows its way around the castle and can serve as a silent guide.</p><p>If one or more characters are mean toward Pidlwick II, its quiet resentment of them grows, and at some point when the group is at the top of a staircase, it pushes one of the offending party members down the stairs. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or tumble to the bottom of the staircase, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.</p><h3>K60. North Tower Peak</h3><p>If the characters climb the stairs to this area, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The stairs end at a dark and dreary room with manacles attached to the walls. In the middle of the room is a wood-framed bed fitted with leather restraints. At the foot of the bed rests a closed iron chest, is lid sculpted with an emblem.</p></aside><p>A wooden ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. Thin streams of water drip through the trapdoor’s rotting wood, forming a puddle around the base of the ladder.</p><p>The ceiling here is 9 feet high. The manacles are rusted and can be easily torn from the walls. The trapdoor in the ceiling leads to the tower rooftop (area K60a).</p><p>The emblem worked into the lid of the iron chest is Strahd’s family crest. (Show the players Strahd’s crest.) Cyrus Belview (see area K62) stashed the chest here for safekeeping.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>The iron chest is locked, and its key is with Cyrus Belview in area K62.</p><p>The chest contains a bejeweled gold crown (worth 2,500 gp) resting on a silk pillow.</p><h4>Teleport Destination</h4><p>Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 arrive in the middle of the room.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside the iron chest.</p><p>If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is standing next to the iron chest.</p><h4>Revision</h4><p>As written, this area contains little more than manacles, a bed, and a chest containing a crown. Because these items have little connection to anything else in the module or the castle, this guide recommends replacing the contents of this area entirely.</p><p>Instead, this area serves as a stable of sorts for Bucephalus. The perimeter of the area is lined with piles of straw that Cyrus brings up in order to feed the fiendish horse. Much of the straw has been burnt black by the flames that emit from Bucephalus’ body.</p><p>In the southern wall, from floor to ceiling, are a large set of double doors, beyond which lies only open air. When characters arrive in the area, the doors are latched shut on the inside. Strahd opens the doors in order to fly Bucephalus in and out.</p><p>Hanging from the northern wall are three leather saddles, all of equisite crafstmanship and worth 60 gold apiece.</p><p>When Bucephalus is not confined to its crypt, being ridden by Strahd or aiding him in battle, it can be found in this area. There is a 20 percent chance that Cyrus is present, tending to the nightmare. If encountered by the characters, Bucephalus is hostile toward them. If reduced to half health, Bucephalus will use its Ethereal Stride action to escape from battle, and will seek out Strahd at the earliest opportunity.</p><h3>K60a. North Tower Rooftop</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A cold wind greets you atop the tower roof, its rain-slicked flagstones surrounded by a twenty-foot-diameter ring of stone battlements. The thunderclouds above suddenly coalesce into the terrible visage of Strahd. The face utters a ghastly moan as thousands of bats fly out of its gaping maw and descend upon the tower.</p></aside><p>Characters who remain on the roof are accosted by ten @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.nackraWSOTYmZj8i]{swarms of bats}, which arrive in 3 rounds.

Elevator Trap</h3><p>See area K31 and the accompanying Elevator Trap diagram before running this encounter.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This dusty, ten-foot-wide, thirty-foot-long corridor has a flat ceiling ten feet overhead. To the south, a web-filled stairway spirals down into darkness. The north end of the hall ends at a wooden door.</p></aside><p>This hallway contains an elevator trap, triggered when at least 400 pounds of pressure is applied to the 10-foot-square section of floor in the center of the hall (marked T on the map), or when the lever in area K31 is raised. A party of adventurers moving in close formation down the hall is certainly heavy enough to trigger the trap.</p><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/maps/Curse%20of%20Strahd/Castle%20Ravenloft/standard/cos-012.jpg\" /><p>A character who searches for traps while crossing the hall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check detects seams in the floor, walls, and ceiling that suggest that the middle section isn’t attached to the rest of the hall. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discerns that the trap can’t be disarmed from this location.</p><p>The middle 10-foot section of the hall is a cleverly hidden elevator compartment, open to the north and south so that it appears to be part of the passageway. When the trap is sprung, two steel portcullises drop from the ceiling at lightning speed to seal off the compartment, trapping within those creatures that triggered the trap. An instant later, the closed-off elevator is propelled up the western half of a 20-foot-wide, 170-foot-tall shaft (area K31a) to the sounds of turning gears and rattling chains. Magic sleep gas fills the compartment as it rises, and a creature trapped inside must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious as though affected by a sleep spell.</p><p>At the same time the elevator rises, a 10-foot cube of granite suspended from heavy chains descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. The massive block lands gently at the bottom of the shaft, filling the previously open 10-foot-by-10-foot space adjacent to where the elevator stood. The block weighs thousands of tons and pulverizes anything in the space where it comes to rest.</p><p>Once the elevator starts rising, its portcullises are locked in place and can’t be lifted. The walls of the shaft are nearly flush with the elevator compartment; only a few inches of space exist between the portcullises and the shaft walls.</p><p>All creatures trapped inside the elevator (including unconscious ones) must roll initiative. The compartment takes 1 round to reach the top of the shaft, stopping just beneath area K47. Each creature inside has one turn to act before the compartment comes to a dead stop. Their initiative rolls determine the order in which the occupants act. Conscious party members can take whatever actions they like. They might search for a way out, wake sleeping party members, cast spells, or take other actions. Unconscious ones can do nothing.</p><p>A character who uses an action to search the ceiling of the elevator finds a secret trapdoor with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. The trapdoor opens downward.</p><p>Any creature on top of the elevator when it reaches the top of the shaft must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed against the ceiling of the shaft. The character takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the elevator comes to a stop, its portcullises retract.</p><p>The elevator remains at the top of the shaft until the lever in area K31 is moved to the “down” position. When that happens, the trap resets in 1 round: the portcullises come down, and the elevator compartment descends to its place in the hallway at the bottom of the shaft as the stone block rises to the top of the shaft. When the elevator reaches the bottom, its portcullises rise again.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>The sound of the elevator moving can be heard throughout the castle. Characters who are trapped or asleep in the elevator compartment are easy prey for Strahd, who can reach them by way of the trapdoor in area K47.</p><h3>K62. Servants’ Hall</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This hall stands in deadly silence. Heavy beams support a sagging, ten-foot-high ceiling. Fog clings to the floor, obscuring everything that lies less than three feet above it. A giant shadow lurches across the ceiling as a dark figure shuffles purposefully down the corridor toward you.</p></aside><p>The figure approaching is Cyrus Belview, a mongrelfolk (see appendix D) and Strahd’s faithful servant. He stands 4 feet, 9 inches tall but appears shorter because of his hunched posture. He has the Keen Hearing and Smell feature. The left side his face is covered with lizard scales, and he has the ears of a panther. His left foot looks like a duck’s webbed foot, and his arms have patches of black dog fur.</p><p>The light in the hall comes from a lantern on the floor behind Cyrus. If the characters have their own light sources, Cyrus sees them, but he will not attack first. He wears a loop of twine around his neck, hanging from which is an iron key and a decorative wooden pendant fitted with a varnished human eyeball. The key unlocks the iron chest in area @UUID[.dHNDr99FtNkL3CBa#k60.-north-tower-peak]{K60}. The wooden pendant is a hag eye given to Cyrus by the night hag Morgantha (see chapter 6), so that she could spy on Strahd. Cyrus doesn’t know that the necklace is magical. See the “Hag Covens” sidebar in the hags entry in the Monster Manual for information about the hag eye.</p><p>Poor old Cyrus is obviously crazy. He has served the master for uncounted years and is devoted to him. Cyrus tries to get the characters to retire to their “room in the tower” (area @UUID[.dHNDr99FtNkL3CBa#k49.-lounge]{K49}). If the characters aren’t sure what room he is talking about, he offers to lead them there.</p><p>If the characters follow Cyrus, he tells them to stay close to him as he leads them through the south door to area @UUID[.xcRPUsf02RAx7nv8#k61.-elevator-trap]{K61} and deliberately sets off the elevator trap there. Cyrus tries his best not to succumb to the sleeping gas as the elevator compartment climbs the shaft (area K31), and he has advantage on the saving throw. Assuming he’s still conscious when the elevator compartment reaches the top of the shaft, Cyrus opens the trapdoor to area @UUID[.dHNDr99FtNkL3CBa#k47.-portrait-of-strahd]{K47} and either leads the characters to area @UUID[.dHNDr99FtNkL3CBa#k49.-lounge]{K49} or, if they’re unconscious, drags them there. After assuring characters who are conscious that “the master will be along shortly,” Cyrus then makes his way back downstairs to the kitchen (area @UUID[.xcRPUsf02RAx7nv8#k65.-kitchen]{K65}).</p><p>If the characters don’t go to their room, Cyrus shakes his head and returns to the work of preparing his dinner in area K65. If the characters take his key, he screams, “The master will not be pleased!” and begins to moan and slap his head, obviously upset. A successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check is enough to make him divulge the key’s purpose, the location of the iron chest, and the chest’s contents.</p><p>When he isn’t being threatened, Cyrus giggles to himself from time to time for no clear reason. He also likes to tell poor jokes at the most inopportune moments.</p><p>Stairs at the east end of the north wall lead up to area @UUID[.AbPIwdNDDwiVYBKm#k23.-servants-entrance]{K23}.</p><p>Along the east wall is a rusted but sturdy iron portcullis that bars the way to area K63. (If the characters peer through the portcullis, read the boxed text for area K63.) The portcullis bars are 1 inch thick and spaced 4 inches apart. The portcullis can be lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p><p>The double doors at the west end of the hall are made of heavy planks banded with steel. They open into area K67.</p><h3>K63. Wine Cellar</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Arched frames of stone form a low, wet ceiling over this wine cellar. Great casks line the walls, their bands rusting and their contents long since spilled onto the floor. A few hungry rats make their home here, but upon your sudden arrival, they retreat to the shadows.</p></aside><p>The rats are harmless. Cyrus Belview (see area K62) treats them like pets.</p><p>Characters who search the room find a crack at the southern end of the west wall. The crack is half an inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to area K18.</p><h4>Wine Casks</h4><p>Each of the twelve large casks here rests on its side in a heavy wooden brace. Three casks stand against the north wall, six against the east wall, and three against the south wall. Decorative lettering is burned into the top of each cask, showing the winery name—the Wizard of Wines—and the name of the wine in the cask.</p><p>Characters with a passive Perception score of 17 or higher, or who succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, discover five bottles Champagne du le Stomp behind a loose brick. This finest of vintages from the Wizard of Wines was long thought entirely lost and is a literally priceless treasure in Barovia. Should characters be willing to do so, the Wachter brothers in Vallaki will pay a hefty sum for the bottles.</p><p><em><strong>Northern Casks.</strong></em> All three of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine’s name is Champagne du le Stomp.</p><p><em><strong>Eastern Casks.</strong></em> Five of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine name burned on each is Red Dragon Crush. Lining the interior of the sixth one is a patch of yellow mold (see “Dungeon Hazards” in chapter 5, “Adventure Environments,” of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). A character who inspects the cask closely and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check sees yellow mold in the cracks between the planks of the cask. If this cask is smashed open, the yellow mold releases a cloud of spores.</p><p><em><strong>Southern Casks.</strong></em> Two of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine name burned on each is Purple Grapemash No. 3. The middle one is home to a purplish black pudding that bursts forth if the cask is broken open.</p><h5>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h5><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside one of the empty casks along the north wall, hidden there by Cyrus Belview.</p><h3>K64. Guards’ Stair</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The long, hollow sigh of the wind breathes a semblance of life into this otherwise featureless staircase.</p></aside><p>The stairway starts at area K68 and goes up past area K13 to area K46.</p><h3>K65. Kitchen</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p><s>A horrible odor of decay fills this steaming hot room. A huge pot bubbles over a blazing fire pit in the center of the room, its green, muddy contents churning. The far wall is lined with pegs, hanging from which are numerous large cooking implements—some of which could easily double as implements of torture.</s></p></aside><p><s>If a character looks into the pot, three human zombies rise up from the bubbling depths and attack. The zombies are slowly being boiled to death, and each has only 13 hit points remaining. If Cyrus Belview (see area K62) is present when the zombies attack, he grabs a heavy club and tries to beat them back into the pot. Cyrus explains that he just isn’t the cook he used to be, and his meals tend to get out of hand these days.</s></p><p>The kitchen must be functional to service Strahd’s mortal servants and provide the dinner for the characters when they are invited to by Strahd.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Outside the door to this room, you catch a whiff of smoked meats, freshly baked bread, and some kind of delicious fresh stew—more tempting than any other food you have encountered in Barovia… save for some particular pastries, maybe. Strahd clearly has not allowed the kitchen in his castle to deteriorate, even if he himself no longer needs it.</p><p>The most notable feature in the kitchen besides the well-stocked larder is a huge kettle slowly bubbling away at the center. The scent is almost unbearably mouthwatering.</p></aside><p>This is not to say that the kitchen is entirely safe for intruders, however. Cyrus keeps a pet kettle @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.SIBlGKShJy73EqX2]{mimic} here (see Appendix B) that likes to pretend it’s a cooking pot. It is well-fed but never passes up an unwary victim. The kettle mimic attacks any creature that comes within 5 feet of it, except Cyrus.</p><h3>K66. Butler’s Quarters</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This twenty-foot-square room is filled wall to wall with clutter. A long, sagging bed sits to one side under a huge faded tapestry that depicts Castle Ravenloft. Dusty lanterns sit in various places, and bright curtains are draped haphazardly about the room. Thousands of pieces of junk cover the floor. Broken swords, crumpled shields, and helmets lie in piles all about. The desk is the only area that seems semi-functional for work.</p></aside><p>Cyrus Belview (see area @UUID[.xcRPUsf02RAx7nv8#k62.-servants-hall]{K62}) uses this room as his lair. Hidden within a desk is a journal with crude observations in scrawled, messy handwriting. Pages have been torn out. Cyrus has used these to send messages to the Abbot via a trained bat he keeps as a pet and messenger.</p><p>Cyrus is no longer just a simple mongrelfolk from the Abbey. Instead, he works as a spy for the Abbot, and his quarters have been updated to reflect his secret occupation.</p><p>Characters who are not careful about opening the door to this room will topple a pile of garbage inside the room, creating a loud noise. This will alert Cyrus to any intruders if he is within 100 feet.</p><p>With a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, the players can discover a bunch of scribbled notes hidden below a recipe book in the desk’s drawer. These contain unnecessarily minute and mostly useless information about the goings-on at Castle Ravenloft. If the characters have been here for long enough, they may find their own names and exploits enumerated here from Cyrus’ perspective.</p><p>If the check succeeds by 3 or more, the characters also discover a ring with 16 keys on it, hung from a hook inside the drawers of the desk, hidden behind a bunch of disused writing utensils. These keys can open the dungeon cells in areas K74 and K75.</p><p>Strahd is, of course, aware that Cyrus works for the Abbot. It amuses him to see Cyrus perform so miserably in his ill-fitting role. On occasion, Strahd also finds it useful to use Cyrus to feed the Abbot information that serves his purpose.</p><h3>K67. Hall of Bones</h3><p>Once a mess hall for the castle guards, this room is now desecrated ground (see “Wilderness Hazards” in chapter 5, “Adventure Environments,” of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Dark stains cover the floor of this area. Large oak tables, scarred and beaten, lay scattered like toys about the room, their wood crushed and splintered. Replacing them are furnishings made entirely of human bones.</p><p>The walls and the twenty-foot-high vaulted ceiling are a sickly yellow color, not because of faded or timeworn plaster but because they are adorned with bones and skulls arranged in a morbidly decorative fashion, giving the room a cathedral-like quality. Four enormous mounds of bones occupy the corners of this ossuary, and garlands of skulls extend from these mounds to a chandelier of bones that hangs from the ceiling above a long table constructed of bones in the center of the room. Ten chairs made of bones and festooned with decorative skulls surround the table, resting atop which is an ornate, bowl-shaped vessel made of yet more bones.</p><p>The doors to the north and south are sheathed in bone, but the steel-banded double doors in the center of the east wall are not. Above these eastern doors is mounted the skull of a dragon.</p></aside><p>Cyrus Belview (see area K62) created this enormous work of art out of the bones of dead servants and slain adventurers. It has taken him many years to complete it. The bones and skulls are held together with gray mortar and white paste. The dark stains on the floor are old bloodstains, caused here when Strahd hunted down and killed the remainder of his castle guards.</p><p>The dragon skull mounted above the eastern doors belonged to Argynvost (see chapter 7), a silver dragon that was killed in the valley by Strahd and his army before the founding of Castle Ravenloft. The skull weighs 250 pounds.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying on the bone table.</p><p>If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is sitting comfortably at one end of the table, holding the skull of a long-dead foe.</p><h3>K68. Guards’ Run</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This ten-foot-wide arched corridor is cold and moist. The cold seems to emanate from an open archway in the west wall.</p></aside><p>The archway leads to area K69. A door at the north end of the hall opens into area K67. To the south, the hallway ends at the foot of a staircase (area K64) that spirals upward.</p><h3>K69. Guards’ Quarters</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Sickly, yellow lichen covers the ceiling of this cold, damp, ten-foot-wide passage running east and west. Opening off both sides of this passage are ten-foot-square alcoves that contain rotting cots, rags, and the skeletal remains of castle guards. A deathly silence fills the hall.</p></aside><p>The yellow lichen is harmless. When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the hall, ten human skeletons leap from the alcoves and attack.</p><h3>K70. Kingsmen Hall</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This thirty-foot-square room is a shambles. Scattered furniture lies in heaps near the walls. Broken bones lie scattered amid crumpled and crushed plate armor. Shields and swords jut from the walls as if driven into them by some tremendous force.</p><p>Two doors stand opposite one another in the center of the north wall and the south wall. A dark archway leads out through the east wall.</p></aside><p>After Strahd was transformed into a vampire, several of the castle guards retreated to this room, but Strahd caught them and slaughtered them in a brutal show of violence. Removing one of the shields or swords from the wall requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. None of the items found here are valuable.</p><h3>K71. Kingsmen Quarters</h3><p>This hall was witness to one of the bloodiest chapters of Strahd’s final fall to darkness. The spirits of Strahd’s former guards, whom he slaughtered here in his fury on the night he was transformed into a vampire, still linger.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This dark passage runs for twenty feet, connecting an archway to the west with an ascending stone staircase to the east. To the north and south are four ten-foot-square alcoves cluttered with rotting cots and dirty rags.</p><p>As you walk through this hall, you sense that you are not alone. A dark shade stalks alongside you, always just at the edge of your peripheral vision if you try to turn around to catch a direct look. Echoes of desperate screams and the clanging of weapons hang in the air—and you can smell fresh blood.</p><p>After a few more steps, you become aware of more faint shades pressed into corners, hands held up in pleading and obviously scared to death. These shades are unmoving, and you realize that each of them huddles over a particularly dark patch of blood on the floor.</p></aside><p>The first dark shade is the @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.JyBe8PpsjhjnTuor]{shadow demon} from area K72. It is an aspect of Strahd made manifest here from the sheer power of his rage when he killed the guards. The lesser shades are six @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.vySHK53M6DSxQ9HZ]{shadows} spawned from the murdered guards, now manifesting here exactly on the spots where they fell.</p><p>In a grotesque reenactment of the past, the shadow demon will attack the shadows if the characters linger here instead of moving straight through the room. The shadows do not defend themselves and the shadow demon does not attack the characters unless attacked first. If attacked, the shadow demon changes its focus from the shadows to the characters. If the shadow demon is defeated while the shadows are still alive, read or paraphrase the following:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A many-voiced moan of soul-deep relief rises from the corners of the hall:</p><p>“free from the devil Strahd, free at last—our loyalty did not save us, but you did!”</p><p>The shades shudder and fall back onto the ground in long-sought solace, before dissipating. They finally seem to have found rest. You can feel some of this relief washing over you yourself—you have pushed the darkness back a little bit today.</p></aside><p>For every shade that is still alive when the shadow demon is defeated, one character in the party gains 5 temporary hit points, and also gains advantage on saving throws against being frightened until the end of their next long rest.</p><p>Beyond the archway to the west is area K70. The staircase (area K20a) that goes up along the east wall leads to area K20.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>Three of the alcoves contain nothing of value. A loose flagstone in the southeast alcove covers a hidden cubbyhole in the floor, in which is hidden a moldy sack containing 150 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character who searches the alcove can find the loose flagstone with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><h3>K72. Chamberlain’s Office</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This shadowy room is in perfect order. A great table stands here with its chair, inkwell, and quill set carefully in place. Lances, swords, and shields that bear the Barovian crest are hung neatly on the dark, oak-paneled walls.</p></aside><p>If he has not been defeated elsewhere, Rahadin (see appendix D) is here, waiting for the characters to arrive so he can kill them.</p><p>A @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.oFECFccnG2HBtXAb]{shadow demon} also haunts this room. In the round after the characters engage Rahadin, the demon leaps out and attacks the nearest character from behind. The character doesn’t notice the demon, unless the character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds the demon’s Dexterity (Stealth) check. Both Rahadin and the shadow demon fight until slain.</p><p>A secret door is set into the north end of the west wall. It can be pulled open to reveal a dusty, web-choked staircase of ancient, worn stone (area K79) that descends into darkness.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":750000,"name":"Dungeon and Catacombs","type":"text","_id":"XWdYpae32oSBtt2H","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Refer to map 12 of the castle for areas K73 through K88.</p><h3>K73.

The water’s surface is like dark, mirrored glass, disturbed only occasionally by the “thwick” of a drop falling from the ceiling. Twenty feet ahead, arched doorways lead downward from each side of the hallway. In each arched doorway, an iron door stands closed and partially submerged. You hear a weak cry for help from beyond the south door.</p></aside><p>The water is 3 feet deep in the hallway and opaque. The steps on both sides of the hallway descend another 2 feet before ending at the iron doors to the north and south.</p><p>The floor beneath the water isn’t as solid as one might expect. There is a safe path around several weight-sensitive trapdoors (see the Traps in Area K73 diagram), but the water makes it impossible to see where the trapdoors are. For every 10 pounds of weight on a trapdoor, there is a 5 percent chance that the trapdoor will open. The 10-foot-deep pit under each trapdoor contains a magic teleport trap that activates as soon as the trapdoor opens. Any Medium or smaller creature on a trapdoor when it opens plunges into the pit and is teleported to a cell in either area K74 or K75, as the diagram indicates.</p><img src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/maps/Curse%20of%20Strahd/Castle%20Ravenloft/standard/cos04-17.png\" /><p>When a character sets off a trap, other characters in the hall see an explosion of air and water fly up around the triggering character (air that was trapped in the pit is released suddenly when the trapdoor opens). The triggering character suddenly falls from sight. An instant later, the trapdoor closes, leaving only a slowly dissipating swirl in the water. It doesn’t open again until 24 hours have passed, at which point its teleport trap is recharged.</p><p>Characters who fall victim to the teleport traps are transported to dungeon cells closed with iron bars and under 5 feet of brackish water (areas K74 and K75).</p><h3>K74.

Each door is fitted with an iron lock. A character using thieves’ tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 1 minute and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character is trying to pick the lock from inside the cell. If the check fails, the character can try again.</p><p>A character can force open a barred door by using an action and succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check.</p><p>Strahd visits the dungeon occasionally to see whether any characters have become trapped here.

He begs the characters to rescue him, offering to help them in exchange.</p><p>In truth, Strahd locked Emil here as punishment for causing a schism in his werewolf pack (see chapter 15). Anxious to prove his worth to Strahd, Emil rewards the characters for freeing him by attacking them when a good opportunity arises. Emil doesn’t turn against the characters if they claim to be allies of his wife, Zuleika (see chapter 15, area Z7). In that case, he tries to leave the castle and reunite with her, staying with the characters only until an opportunity to leave presents itself.</p><h4>K75b. Forgotten Treasure</h4><p>Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting beneath their feet.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Scattered across the floor of this cell are 2,100 ep.

Brazier Room</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This room is thirty feet square, rising to a twenty-foot-tall flat ceiling. A stone brazier burns fiercely in the center of the room, but its tall white flame produces no heat.

Within each indentation is a spherical stone, twice the diameter of a human eyeball and made of a colored crystal. No two stones are the same color.</p><p>Overhead, a wood-framed hourglass as tall and wide as a dwarf hangs ten feet above the brazier, suspended from the ceiling by thick iron chains. All the sand is stuck in the upper portion of the hourglass, seemingly unable to run down into the bottom. Written in glowing script on the base of the hourglass is a verse in Common.</p><p>Two nine-foot-tall iron statues of knights on horseback, poised to charge with swords drawn, stand in deep alcoves facing each other. The brazier sits between them.</p></aside><p>The two statues are iron golems. Each horse and rider is considered one creature, and they are inseparable. The golems will not leave the room under any circumstances, and they attack only under specific conditions (see the “Development” section that follows).</p><p>The hourglass has AC 12, 20 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder damage. If the hourglass is reduced to 0 hit points, its glass shatters, causing the sand within it to fall to the floor. The magic writing on the base of the hourglass reads as follows:</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><em>Cast a stone into the fire:<br />Violet leads to the mountain spire<br />Orange to the castle’s peak<br />Red if lore is what you seek<br />Green to where the coffins hide<br />Indigo to the master’s bride<br />Blue to ancient magic’s womb<br />Yellow to the master’s tomb</em></p></aside><p>The brazier’s flame is magical and sheds no warmth. A successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) extinguishes the flame for 1 hour. The fire is permanently extinguished if the brazier is destroyed. The brazier has AC 17, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage.</p><p>The stones set into the brazier’s rim are colored red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, respectively. Tossing one into the brazier causes its flame to change from white to the color of the stone, and the sand begins falling through the hourglass. Any creature that touches the colored flame is teleported to a location within Strahd’s domain, as determined by the color:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Flame Color</th><th>Teleports to …</th></tr><tr><td>Red</td><td>Study (area @UUID[.cpfE4WX83bagJvy8#k37.-study]{K37})</td></tr><tr><td>Orange</td><td>North tower peak (area @UUID[.dHNDr99FtNkL3CBa#k60.-north-tower-peak]{K60})</td></tr><tr><td>Yellow</td><td>Strahd’s tomb (area K86)</td></tr><tr><td>Green</td><td>Coffin maker’s shop (chapter 5, area N6f)</td></tr><tr><td>Blue</td><td>Amber Temple (chapter 13, area X42)</td></tr><tr><td>Indigo</td><td>Abbey of Saint Markovia (chapter 8, area S17)</td></tr><tr><td>Violet</td><td>Tsolenka Pass (chapter 9, area T4)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After 5 rounds, the sand runs out, and the color of the flame returns to white. When the flame does so, the sand instantly reappears in the top part of the hourglass (provided the hourglass is intact), and the stone that was cast into the fire reappears in the brazier’s rim.</p><p>Once a character has been teleported using the brazier, the portal that brought them to their new location stays open for five minutes and can be used as a two-way teleportation circle. The portal is visible as a circle of blood-red runes on the ground that slowly fade into black smoke over the duration, indicating that the portal will close soon. This change prevents characters from being scattered all over Barovia with no fast method of return, potentially during a crucial moment of the story.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>If the brazier, the hourglass, or either golem is attacked, the doors of the room magically slam shut and lock (unless they are being held or wedged open), and the golems animate and attack. On the first round, the golems fill the room with their poison breath, which issues from the horses’ mouths. (Each creature in the room must make two saving throws, one for each breath weapon.) On subsequent rounds, each golem makes one attack with its sword and one slam attack with its hoof. When there are no creatures left to fight in the room, the golems return to their alcoves, and the doors unlock. Forcing open a locked door requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Each door has AC 15, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><h3>K79. Western Stair</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This staircase of ancient stone is worn smooth. Thick dust covers its steps, and cobwebs choke the passage.</p></aside><p>The stairs rise at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 40 feet horizontally, leading to a 10-foot-square landing (see below). A second set of stairs continues upward to the east at a similar angle for a distance of 30 feet horizontally, ending at a secret door that opens into area K72.</p><h4>Landing</h4><p>Inscribed on the landing, hidden under years of dust, is a glyph of warding. If the characters brush away the dust, someone can spot the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p><p>The glyph triggers the first time a living creature passes over it. Triggering it activates a major image spell, conjuring an illusion of Strahd von Zarovich that appears either halfway up the stairs leading to area K72 or halfway down the stairs leading to area K78, so that the vampire appears in front of the triggering character. When “Strahd” appears, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A sickly mist fills the stairway ahead, then coalesces into the form of the vampire Strahd, his eyes burning red with anger. “You have worn out your welcome,” he says. “Whatever gods you believe in cannot save you now!”</p></aside><p>Have the characters roll initiative. Any attack or spell that hits “Strahd” passes through, revealing that he is an illusion. On initiative count 0, the illusory vampire chuckles and melts away like a wax doll in a bonfire, leaving no trace behind, and the glyph disappears.</p><p>Strahd did not place a mere illusion of himself here, but a more elaborate spell trap to protect the teleportation mechanism in area K78. When the glyph of warding is triggered, it releases a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-9-spells.hAx0UoQeCLzLOeRD]{Mental Prison} spell (save DC 14) on the creature that triggered the trap. The illusion that appears to the target is Strahd, standing in front of them and staring menacingly, holding a glass of red liquid.</p><h3>K80. Center Stair</h3><p>If the characters enter this area through the door at the bottom of the stairs, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The door creaks open to reveal a stone staircase between rough masonry walls. There is little dust on the steps, but light fog tumbles down the steps from above.</p></aside><p>If the characters enter this area at the top of the staircase, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The rough-hewn corridor ends at a stone staircase that descends to the south. Flanked by walls of rough masonry and relatively free of dust, these stairs descend before ending at a lonely door.</p></aside><p>The stairs slope at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 20 feet horizontally, connecting areas K78 and K81.</p><h3>K81. Tunnel</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This tunnel is cut into the Pillarstone of Ravenloft itself. Its surface is slick, and its ceiling is barely 6 feet high. A lingering fog limits visibility to a few feet.</p></aside><p>Characters who have knowledge of stonecutting can tell that this passage is a relatively new construction compared to other areas of Ravenloft. The tunnel is 120 feet long, with a stone door at its eastern end.</p><p>Near the midpoint of the tunnel is a trapdoor hidden under a layer of fog. Characters can’t spot the trapdoor passively, but an active search accompanied by a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check locates it. Unless the trapdoor is fastened shut with an iron spike or by some other means, it opens when 100 pounds of weight or more is placed on it. When the trapdoor opens, everyone who is standing on it slides into the marble chute below (area K82). The trapdoor then resets.</p><h3>K82. Marble Slide</h3><p>If one or more characters fall through the trapdoor in area K81, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You fall into a chute of polished black marble and slide into the darkness.</p></aside><p>The chute plunges from the trapdoor in area K81 through a one-way secret door into a flooded cell (area K74e). Characters who slide all the way to the bottom are deposited in the cell, but take no damage. The slide contains no handholds and is too slippery to ascend without the aid of magic.</p><h3>K83. Spiral Stair</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Behind the door lies a dark spiral staircase.</p></aside><p>The staircase starts at area K78, climbs to a landing at area K83a, and continues upward to area K37.</p><h3>K83a. Spiral Stair Landing</h3><p>An extension of area K83, this landing is shown on map 11.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This forty-foot-long corridor connects two spiral stairways, one leading up and the other descending into the depths of Castle Ravenloft. Hanging from an iron rod bolted to the eastern wall is a dusty, ten-foot-square tapestry depicting knights on horseback charging across a battlefield under a bloodred sky. The lead knight rides a black horse and wears a fur-lined black cloak, dark gray armor, and a visored helm shaped like a wolf’s head. His sword glows with the light of the sun.</p></aside><p>The stairs at the north end of the west wall descends to a door leading to area K78. The stairs at the south end of the west wall lead up, ending at door that opens into area K37.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>The tapestry depicts Strahd’s father, King Barov, leading his fearsome knights into glorious battle. The tapestry weighs 10 pounds and is worth 750 gp intact. If it becomes damaged while in the party’s possession, it is worthless unless mended.</p><h3>K84. Catacombs</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Buried deep beneath the keep of Ravenloft lie ancient catacombs, with arched ceilings supported by wide, hollow columns that double as crypts. Cobwebs hang limp in the musty air. A thick fog clings to the floor, which is covered in putrid waste. The black ceiling is moving.</p></aside><p>The catacombs fill an area roughly 110 feet east to west by 180 feet north to south, and the floor is covered in several inches of bat guano. The catacombs are made up of 10-foot-wide arched walkways running between 10-foot-square crypts, which serve as pillars that support the 20-foot-high ceiling. The area has five means of entry and exit:</p><ul><li><p>The door adjacent to crypt 1 (connecting with area K81)</p></li><li><p>A barred archway to the north (connecting with area K85)</p></li><li><p>A barred archway to the south (connecting with area K86 but warded by teleport traps)</p></li><li><p>A barred archway to the east (connecting with area K87)</p></li><li><p>The high tower stair (area K18) or the shaft (area K18a) to the west</p></li></ul><p>Each crypt is sealed with a chiseled stone “door”—actually a tight-fitting stone slab measuring 3 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 3 inches thick. Removing or resetting a stone slab requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p><p>Each crypt houses the remains of the person or persons whose epitaph is inscribed on the front of the slab. The crypts are described in the following sections, their epitaphs noted under the crypt’s number in italics.</p><p>Unless noted otherwise, each crypt contains a 3-foot-by-6-foot rectangular bier of marble, 3 feet high, with a skeleton draped in rags lying atop it.</p><p>The catacombs are home to tens of thousands of bats. The bats hang here during daytime hours and fly out in the evening through the high tower’s central shaft (area K18a) to hunt at night. They will not attack intruders unless they are provoked or are specifically commanded to do so by Strahd. If one or more bats within a 10-foot square on the map are attacked or caught in the area of a harmful spell, 2d4 swarms of bats form in that area and attack. No more swarms can be formed in that square until the next dawn, when more bats arrive to replenish those that were killed.</p><h4>Teleport Traps</h4><p>Invisible teleport traps are located between crypts 37 and 38, between crypt 37 and the wall south of it, and between crypt 38 and the wall south of it. The traps can’t be perceived except with a detect magic spell, which reveals an aura of conjuration magic in the trapped areas. Although the traps can’t be disarmed, a successful casting of dispel magic (DC 16) on a trap suppresses its magic for 1 minute, allowing characters to move safely through its area. A trap is also suppressed while wholly or partly in the area of an antimagic field.</p><p>These teleport traps form a protective ring around the entrance to Strahd’s tomb (area K86). Any creature that enters one of these 10-foot-square spaces is instantly teleported away, switching places with one of the wights in crypt 14. The wight materializes in the creature’s previous location and attacks any living creature it sees.</p><h4>Crypt 1</h4><p><em>Herein lie the ones who walk the path of pain and torment</em></p><p>The stone door connects not with a crypt, but with a hewn tunnel of stone (area K81).</p><h4>Crypt 2</h4><p><em>Artista DeSlop—Court Ceiling Painter</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The domed ceiling of this crypt is painted with an image of imps holding bouquets of colorful flowers. A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. A wooden box is tucked under one bony hand.</p></aside><p>The box is unlocked. It contains seven wood-handled paintbrushes and seven small gourds of dried-up paint.</p><h4>Crypt 3</h4><p><em>Lady Isolde Yunk (Isolde the Incredible): Purveyor of antiques and imports</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Piled all around it, covering the floor, are heaps of old baskets, braziers, bundled tapestries, candlesticks, chairs, chests, cooking utensils, cressets, curtain rods, decanters, dishes, jugs, lamps, scroll cases, tankards, and tinderboxes. None of the junk looks valuable. An old chandelier hangs from the domed ceiling.</p></aside><p>Characters could spend hours searching the crypt. Though the antiques here might fetch a fair amount of coin, they are hardly worth the trouble to transport.</p><h4>Crypt 4</h4><p><em>Prince Ariel du Plumette (Ariel the Heavy)</em></p><p>If the characters open the door to this crypt, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The apparition of a large, rotund man forms within the dark crypt, its eyes wild with insanity. Large, artificial wings unfold from its back.</p></aside><p>Prince Ariel was a terrible man who longed to fly. He attached artificial wings to a harness and empowered the device with magic, but the apparatus still couldn’t bear his weight, and he plunged from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to his death. His evil @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.8fQwlt0H09LByPHZ]{ghost} attacks the characters on sight. If Ariel succeeds in possessing a character, his host climbs the high tower (area K18) until it reaches the peak (area K59), then hurls itself down the tower’s central shaft (area K18a), screaming, “I can fly!” the whole way down.</p><h4>Crypt 5</h4><p><em>Artank Swilovich: Friend and member of the Barovian Wine Distillers Guild</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You are greeted by the faint smell of wine. A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Heaped around it, covering the entire floor, are thousands of empty wine bottles.</p></aside><p>Each bottle’s label shows that it is from the Wizard of Wines winery, and the label names the wine inside: Champagne du le Stomp, Red Dragon Crush, or Purple Grapemash No. 3.</p><h5>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h5><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried under the wine bottles. A character who searches under the bottles finds the treasure automatically.</p><h4>Crypt 6</h4><p><em>Saint Markovia: Dead for all time</em></p><p>The 10-foot-square section of floor in front of this crypt is a pressure plate that releases four poison darts hidden in tiny holes in the north wall. (See “Sample Traps” in chapter 5, “Adventure Environments,” of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for the rules on how this trap functions.) The trap resets when the weight is lifted and can be triggered a total of four times before its supply of darts is depleted.</p><p>If the door to the crypt is opened, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This crypt smells of roses. The remains atop its marble slab have disintegrated, except for one thighbone.</p></aside><p>If the characters disturb Saint Markovia’s remains, add:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A ghostly form appears above the dust, so faint that you can barely discern more than part of a face. From this apparition comes the faintest of whispers: “The vampire must be destroyed. Use me as your weapon.” With that, it fades away.</p></aside><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> A detect magic spell reveals that the thighbone radiates an aura of evocation magic. See appendix C for more information on @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.items.ciyTjWy4gIAphRZY]{Saint Markovia’s thighbone}.</p><h4>Crypt 7</h4><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The stone door of this crypt lies on the floor, its inscription obscured by fog. The crypt gapes open. A skull, some bones, and a few bits of rusted armor lie atop a marble slab with a leering stone gargoyle squatting at each end.</p></aside><p>The epitaph on the door reads “Endorovich (Endorovich the Terrible): What the blood of a hundred wars did not do, the spurn of a woman accomplished.”</p><p>Endorovich was a ruthless soldier and self-aggrandizing noble who loved a woman named Marya, but she loved another man. As Marya and her lover were dining, Endorovich put poison into the man’s wineglass. The glasses were mixed up, and Marya drank the poison instead. The lover was hanged for murdering Marya and buried at the Ivlis River crossroads (chapter 2, area F). Endorovich never got over his guilt and, out of madness, killed many in his lifetime.</p><p>Endorovich’s spirit is trapped inside one of the gargoyles. If anyone disturbs the bones on the slab, one of the @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.actor-1-monsters.QjFYMPba7kSzF5Vo]{gargoyles} awakens and attacks. If the gargoyle is reduced to 0 hit points, Endorovich’s spirit moves to the second gargoyle, which then awakens and attacks. Both gargoyles have maximum hit points (77). Once the second gargoyle is destroyed, Endorovich’s spirit is laid to rest.</p><h5>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h5><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is contained in a secret compartment under Endorovich’s remains. Once his bones and dust are swept away, the compartment can be found and opened without an ability check.</p><h4>Crypt 8</h4><p><em>Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Hanging on the back wall is a handsome quilt that depicts a royal feast.</p></aside><p>The quilt is magically preserved but not valuable.</p><h4>Crypt 9</h4><p><em>Pidlwick—Fool of Dorfniya</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A small skeleton wearing the remains of a fool’s costume lies atop a stumpy marble slab in the center of the crypt.</p></aside><p>If Pidlwick II (see area K59) is with the party, it refuses to enter the crypt. The slab in this crypt is 4 feet long (instead of the usual 6 feet long). The bones atop the slab belong to the fool servant of Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya (see crypt 8).</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> If the characters explore this crypt after summoning the ghost of Pidlwick in area K36, they find a small, flat wooden box on the marble slab next to Pidlwick’s bones. The box contains a full deck of illusions.</p><h4>Crypt 10</h4><p><em>Sir Leonid Krushkin (Sir Lee the Crusher): Bigger than life, he loved his jewelry</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>An oversized skeleton draped in jewelry and rags lies atop an elongated marble slab in the center of the crypt. Leaning against the slab is a bloodstained maul strung with cobwebs.</p></aside><p>Sir Lee stood well over seven feet tall. His maul might give the characters pause, but it is harmless and nonmagical.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Three jeweled necklaces (worth 750 gp each) are lying across Sir Lee’s skeleton.</p><h4>Crypt 11</h4><p><em>Tasha Petrovna—Healer of Kings, Light unto the West, Servant, Companion</em></p><p>A skeleton wearing tattered priestly vestments lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. The domed ceiling overhead is painted with a glorious sun mural.</p><p>Creatures that would take damage from exposure to sunlight (such as vampires) have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws while inside this crypt.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Draped around the neck of the skeleton is a sun-shaped holy symbol (worth 25 gp). A good-aligned character who picks up the holy symbol hears a ghostly female voice. It whispers the following message:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>“There is a grave to the west, with roses that never die, in a place built by healers, in a village called Krezk. When all turns to darkness, touch this holy symbol to the grave to summon the light and find a treasure long lost.”</p></aside><p>The message refers to a gravestone in the Abbey of Saint Markovia (chapter 8, area S7).</p><h4>Crypt 12</h4><p><em>King Troisky—The Three-Faced King</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>There are no bones atop the marble slab in this crypt, only a steel helm with a visor shaped like an angry face.</p></aside><p>The helm has three evenly spaced visors crafted to look like human faces—one sad, one happy, and one angry. Only the angry visage is visible from the crypt’s doorway. King Troisky wore this three-faced helm in battle, earning him the moniker of Three-Faced King. The helm is nonmagical and weighs 10 pounds.</p><p>The slab upon which the helm rests is weight-sensitive. If the helm is removed from the slab without 10 pounds of weight immediately being added, poisonous gas pours out of the slab’s hollow interior and fills the crypt. A character who searches the slab for traps and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check spots tiny holes bored into the slab’s marble base. It’s from these holes that the gas spews forth.</p><p>A creature in the crypt when the gas is released must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h4>Crypt 13</h4><p><em>King Katsky (Katsky the Bright): Ruler, inventor, and self-proclaimed time traveler</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Lying amid the bones is a stoppered drinking horn, a fat pouch, and a weird-looking scepter made of metal and wood. Above the bones, hanging from the domed ceiling by wires, is a wooden flying contraption that looks like a set of folding dragon wings fitted with leather straps, metal buckles, and taut leather wing flaps.</p></aside><p>The stoppered drinking horn is a water-resistant powder horn loaded with gunpowder, and the “weird-looking scepter” is a musket. The fat pouch contains 20 silver marbles (silvered bullets for the musket). For more information on firearms and explosives, see chapter 9, “Dungeon Master’s Workshop,” of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.</p><p><em><strong>Glider.</strong></em> Any Small or Medium humanoid can wear the dragon-wing glider. (It takes 1 minute to don or doff the glider.) It can’t support more than 80 pounds, although the amount of weight it can carry is not evident. A character who inspects the glider in an attempt to discern its maximum weight allowance can do so accurately with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.</p><p>If its wearer is light enough (accounting for gear), the apparatus can be used to glide, but only in wide-open spaces where there is room to maneuver. The wearer can become airborne by stepping or jumping off a high place, or by performing a high jump to take off from level ground. While aloft, the wearer gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, with the following limitations: except in a significant updraft, the wearer can’t use the glider to gain altitude, and the glider descends 1 foot for every 10 feet of horizontal distance covered. At the end of the flight, the wearer lands on its feet and the glider is intact. If the wearer tries to accelerate the rate of descent, the glider breaks, and the wearer falls.</p><p>The glider has AC 12, 1 hit point, and a 15-foot wingspan. Any damage causes it to break and become inoperable. A mending cantrip can repair the damage, provided all the broken pieces are present.</p><h4>Crypt 14</h4><p><em>Stahbal Indi-Bhak: A truer friend no ruler ever had. Here lies his family in honor.</em></p><p>If the characters open the door to this crypt, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A ten-foot-square shaft plunges into darkness. The sound of slowly dripping water echoes up the shaft.</p></aside><p>Characters who have darkvision or a sufficient light source can see that the shaft descends 40 feet to some kind of vault deep in the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Stones protrude from the shaft at regular intervals, offering handholds and footholds. The stones are slippery, however, so a character who tries to scale the wall without the aid of magic or the use of a climber’s kit must make a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p><em><strong>Vault.</strong></em> When the characters reach the bottom of the shaft, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>At the bottom of the shaft is a dank vault with a ten-foot-high ceiling. The room is awkwardly shaped and smells of rotten meat. Fifteen stone coffins are scattered throughout the vault, all oriented with their heads pointed north. The floor is covered with human bones and rusty swords.</p></aside><p>If a character teleports into a coffin from one of the teleport traps that protect Strahd’s tomb (area K86), read the following to that character’s player:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A flash of light explodes around you, and then you are plunged into absolute darkness, suddenly lying in a confined space choked with dust.</p></aside><p>This vault contains fifteen wights (one per coffin), minus any that have been teleported away (see “Teleport Traps” at the start of this section). Lifting a coffin’s lid requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p><p>Each wight remains inactive until it is teleported away or until its coffin is opened, whereupon it attacks.</p><p>The bones and rusty swords cover the floor to a depth of 6 inches, and are the remains of servants who swore to avenge Stahbal Indi-Bhak’s family. Whenever a wight is killed in this vault, some of the bones knit together, forming 2d6 animated human skeletons. These skeletons attack intruders on sight but have no ranged attacks. There are enough bones and swords in the room for one hundred skeletons to form in this manner.</p><h4>Crypt 15</h4><p><em>Khazan: His word was power</em></p><p>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. The skull has black opals set in its eye sockets and shards of amber where its teeth should be.</p><p>Khazan was a powerful archmage who unlocked the secrets of lichdom, then later tried to become a demilich and failed. Neither his skull nor his bones pose any threat, but the gems embedded in the skull are valuable.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The skull’s black opal eye-gems are worth 1,000 gp apiece. The skull also has eight amber teeth worth 100 gp each.</p><p>Any creature that stands inside the crypt and boldly speaks the name “Khazan” causes the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to tremble as a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-6-items.vesmxyrYqPbMiv7u]{staff of power} materializes above the marble slab and hovers in place. The first creature to grab hold of the staff must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Afterward, the staff of power can be held and used normally. If no one grabs the staff within 1 round of its appearance, it vanishes, never to return.</p><h4>Crypt 16</h4><p><em>Elsa Fallona von Twitterberg (Beloved Actor): She had many followers</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Nine shallow alcoves are carved into the surrounding walls. The back wall of each alcove is painted with a full-body image of a handsome man. Some of the men wear fine clothes; others wear armor. At the feet of each painting rests a skull atop a pile of bones.</p></aside><p>The bones in the niches belong to Elsa’s nine consorts. There is nothing of value here.</p><h4>Crypt 17</h4><p><em>Sir Sedrik Spinwitovich (Admiral Spinwitovich): Confused though he was, he built the greatest naval force ever assembled in a landlocked country</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>An eleven-foot-long funeral barge dominates this crypt, wedged diagonally into the available space. Lying in the boat is a skeleton draped in rags, with hundreds of gold coins piled around it.</p></aside><p>The coins are made of clay painted gold and are worthless. The funeral barge, which was assembled inside the crypt, is too big to fit through the door.</p><h4>Crypt 18</h4><p><em>Ludmilla Vilisevic- Wife</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This crypt is sparsely decorated with bare stone walls. It is immaculately clean. A stone sarcophagus stands at the northern wall.</p></aside><p>This crypt is immaculate as it is swept daily by Helga, bullied by Ludmillaa.

She felt a great bond with him and asked to solemnize that bond in a dark marriage. Drawn to her knowledge and power, Strahd consented, but before he could drain all life from Patrina, her own people stoned her to death in an act of mercy to thwart Strahd’s plans. Strahd demanded, and got, Patrina’s body. She then became the banshee trapped here.</p><p>Reducing the banshee to 0 hit points causes it to discorporate. Patrina’s spirit can’t rest, however, until she is formally wed to Strahd; the banshee re-forms in her crypt 24 hours later.

Perched on it are dozens of stone ravens, their eyes fixed on the marble slab.</p></aside><p>The carved ravens are ominous yet harmless.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The prefect’s gold holy symbol is festooned with tiny gemstones and is worth 750 gp. If touched by an evil creature, the holy symbol is consumed in a blast of intense light that deals 11 (2d10) radiant damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. Characters familiar with Barovian religion recognize the symbol as that of the Morninglord.</p><h4>Crypt 31</h4><p><em>We knew him only by his wealth</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This crypt is empty. Its walls are painted to depict mountains of gold coins.</p></aside><p>The floor of the crypt is actually the cover of a 30-foot-deep spiked pit. The cover opens if 100 pounds of weight or more are placed on it. It splits down the middle, east to west, and its doors are spring-loaded. After a victim or victims fall into the pit, its doors snap shut. (See “Sample Traps” in chapter 5, “Adventure Environments,” of the Dungeon Master’s Guide the rules on locking pits and spiked pits.) The spikes at the bottom of the pit are made of iron but aren’t poisoned.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> A human skeleton (the remains of a dead adventurer) wrapped in bits of studded leather armor lies amid the spikes at the bottom of the pit.

He claimed descent from a duke of the Nine Hells, and his deeds did justice to this ancestry. His sarcophagus is made of beaten lead and encased in gold (see “Treasure” below). Its lid can be pried open with a crowbar or similar tool, revealing nothing but dust within. The stuffed owlbear is a late addition to the crypt’s decor—a gift given to Strahd that wound up here. It looks almost alive but is harmless.</p><p>An invisible @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.ySIvL1ZbEHvvh7Kx]{imp} is perched atop the owlbear. If someone tries to open the sarcophagus, the imp says in Common, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you!” The imp is magically bound to King Dostron’s remains and must watch over them for several more centuries before its contract are fulfilled. It isn’t obligated to protect the contents of the crypt (so it will not attack), and it delights in telling lies and engaging in mischief. For instance, it warns the characters that the sarcophagus is trapped, and that opening the lid will free a pit fiend bound within.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Characters who take the time to pry the gold from the sarcophagus can amass 500 gp worth of the precious metal, weighing 10 pounds.</p><h4>Crypt 35</h4><p><em>Sir Jarnwald the Trickster: The joke was on him</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A charnel stench fills this empty crypt.</p></aside><p>The floor here is an illusion that hides a 20-foot-deep pit.

The silence can be dispelled, as can the illusory floor (DC 14 for both).</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Sir Jarnwald was “entombed” here, so far as he was pushed into the crypt and devoured by the ghouls.

The floor of the crypt is covered with a woven straw mat, and the walls are lined with shelves containing mechanical components for traps. Tucked away in a box, characters can find a hand-drawn map of Castle Ravenloft’s interior, which Volenta made shortly after becoming a vampire so that she would not get lost in the castle.</p><h4>Crypt 37</h4><p><em>Gralmore Nimblenobs—Wizard Ordinaire</em></p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Lying on a marble slab in the center of this crypt is the corpse of a man with a long white beard. His skin clings tightly to his skull and bones, and he wears dusty red robes. Clutched to his chest is a wooden staff that has a brass knob on one end and a marble knob on the other.</p></aside><p>The staff is a nonmagical quarterstaff.</p><p>Inspection of the marble slab reveals a shallow, concave recess at one end. If the marble-knobbed end of Gralmore’s staff is placed in the recess, the slab levitates 5 feet upward, revealing a compartment underneath (see “Treasure” below). The slab slowly sinks back into place after 1 minute.

This is the lute that Escher used during his travels as a bard before Strahd turned him into a vampire.</p><h3>K85. Sergei’s Tomb</h3><p>A portcullis is closed in the archway into this tomb. Lifting it requires a successful DC 25 Strength check.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>White marble steps descend to a tomb that has a vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead. A stillness—a calm amid the storm—is felt here. In the center of the tomb, a white marble slab supports an intricately inlaid coffin. Chiseled into the slab is a name: Sergei von Zarovich. To the north, behind the coffin, are three alcoves. A beautifully carved statue stands in each alcove—a stunning young man flanked by two angels—looking as polished and new as the day each was placed there. An iron lever protrudes from the south wall, west of the tomb’s entrance.</p></aside><p>Raising the lever lifts the portcullis at the top of the stairs. Pulling it down lowers the portcullis.</p><p>The coffin opens easily to the touch of a lawful good creature. Otherwise, opening it requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. Sergei’s flesh has been magically preserved, and at first glance it looks like he is sleeping in his casket.</p><p>Sergei von Zarovich was, in many ways, the antithesis to Strahd. Where Strahd was a ruthless conqueror and politician who grew up away from his family, hardened by the necessities of a life on the battlefield, Sergei was a pious man who was raised in the loving care of Queen Ravenovia, naïve of the harsher aspects of life. Strahd killed his brother Sergei in his rage over his love Tatyana favoring the younger Sergei, but he is haunted by this mistake and still loves and mourns his brother, in his own twisted way.</p><p>Desecrating Sergei’s tomb, one of the few places left in Barovia to house a gentle and loving spirit, comes at a heavy cost to any character who is of good or neutral alignment. If such a character removes any item from the tomb, they are cursed with the Brightbane curse.

A Small creature can squeeze behind and around one of the bronze statues to circumvent the light curtain.</p><p>The effect of the curtain protecting this area is reversed—it no longer allows the passage of any living being, but dead and undead can pass unhindered. This allows Strahd to visit his beloved parents but keeps out any of his living servants or current paramours not yet turned into vampire spawn.</p><p>An inscription in the wall above the curtain reads:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Here, beyond death’s door, lie King Barov and Queen Ravenovia.

They further realize that the reference to passing death’s door can be taken literally, and means that a creature that has previously died and been resurrected may also enter.</p><p>If a living being attempts to pass the curtain, it is teleported back to the top of the stairs behind it and Strahd’s voice rings through its mind: “This place is not for you.”</p><h3>K88.

Tall, stained glass windows dominate the eastern walls, allowing dim light to fall on two coffins resting atop white marble slabs.

The vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead is inlaid with a beautiful gold mosaic.</p></aside><p>The stained glass windows are so dirty on the outside as to be nearly opaque. The windows don’t open, but they can be smashed easily. Anyone who looks upward through a window can see, 110 feet above, the castle’s stone overlook (area K6).

The old king’s bones lie in a compartment beneath his effigy.</p><p>The south coffin holds the skeleton of Strahd’s mother, Queen Ravenovia. (The magic that was meant to preserve her earthly remains failed years ago.) A tattered white shroud covers her bones.</p><p>This tomb is an eerie place that has both a hallowed and a desecrated quality to it. Strahd truly loved his mother, Queen Ravenovia, and respected and wanted to please his father, King Barov, greatly. However, Strahd’s very nature and his and his father’s shared lust for conquest and power mean that nothing created by them can ever truly be pure.</p><p>The entire area is desecrated ground (see p. 110 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) and a supernatural silence reigns here, as befits the dignity of those laid to rest here—no sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.

His body, and his staff of power, lie in the crypts of Castle Ravenloft to this day (@UUID[.XWdYpae32oSBtt2H#crypt-15]{Crypt 15}).</p><p>The castle completed, Strahd summoned his surviving family—his mother, Ravenovia, and his younger brother, Sergei—to join him at the new seat of the von Zarovich line. Queen Ravenovia, who was old, and in poor health—perhaps due to the whispered curses and dark prayers of Baba Lysaga—passed away during the journey. Sergei arrived alone, and joined his brother at Ravenloft.</p><p>Rahadin, Strahd’s most trusted general and adoptive brother, came to reside at the castle as Strahd’s chamberlain. At some point, the Duchess Dorfinya Dilisnya journeyed to Barovia alongside her beloved fool, Pidlwick, hoping to win the hand of Count Strahd von Zarovich. In an effort to earn Strahd’s favor, she commissioned the legendary toymaker, Fritz von Weerg, to build Pidlwick II, a clockwork effigy of Pidlwick. The Duchess, however, soon succumbed to illness after a harsh winter trapped her in the castle for several months. Pidlwick perished as well after falling victim to the murderous envy of his clockwork counterpart.</p><p>In time, a new suitress came to Strahd’s door: the dusk elf archmage Patrina Velikovna. Strahd was taken by her passion for the secrets of immortality, and voyaged with her to the Amber Temple to forge a pact with the dark gods that lay within. When he returned, however, he learned that his brother, Sergei, had found a new romance with a Barovian peasant girl named Tatyana—and Strahd’s heart was set aflame with jealousy and lust. </p><p>Patrina was swiftly set aside, and Strahd became consumed with envy for his brother’s impending marriage. On the day of the wedding, Strahd lured Sergei to the royal chambers, slit his throat, and drank his blood. This sealed his pact with Vampyr, one of the vestiges of the Amber Temple. The guards of the castle fell upon Strahd, killing him—but Strahd was resurrected as a vampire. Newly immortal and fueled by the power of undeath, Strahd rampaged through the castle, killing his own guards and subjects. Many of those slain still linger in the castle today, whether as wights, skeletons, or zombies. Tatyana fled from him—and leapt from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft into the abyss below to escape. Her body was never found.</p><p>Rahadin, eager to distract his master from Tatyana’s death, helped Strahd lure more women to the castle, lavishing them with jewels and fine clothes before Strahd drained their lives and turned them into vampire spawn. When Patrina heard of Tatyana’s death and Strahd’s rebirth as a vampire, she returned to Castle Ravenloft. However, this time Strahd saw that she craved only his power, and Patrina came to understand that he would never love her. Soon after, Patrina was stoned to death by the Dusk Elves at the direction of her brother, Kasimir, and her body was laid to rest in the crypts below the castle.</p><p>Over the five centuries since Strahd’s death, many adventurers have traveled to Barovia, most unintentionally, lured there by the mists and Strahd’s own desire for entertainment. In that time, all have fallen. Their spirits live on as ghosts, rising each night from the earth of the cemetery in the Village of Barovia and marching along the Svalich Road toward the castle. Once there, they fling themselves from the top of the highest tower, plummeting to the catacombs below as their spirits relive their deaths, surrounded by the vampiric husks of those they once called “friend.”</p><p>So too, shall it be, for all others who challenge Castle Ravenloft—unless and until Strahd is slain.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"x6GU4Y7VAzayq22v","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Ybf10iEMlGPNSH7P.JournalEntryPage.x6GU4Y7VAzayq22v"}}},{"sort":1000000,"name":"K20 Heart of Sorrow","type":"image","_id":"pN1k9zMepYjlYlPX","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Heart of Sorrow"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/heart-of-sorrow.jpg","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1100000,"name":"K25 Audience Hall","type":"image","_id":"JpTOuNCoqE1LDVAB","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Audience Hall"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/ravenloft-audiencehall.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1200000,"name":"K67 Hall of Bones","type":"image","_id":"WT2GBkM5Sq64s5UQ","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Hall of Bones"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/hall-of-bones.jpg","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1300000,"name":"K84 Catacombs","type":"image","_id":"RUCHdoEPPFI9LWWC","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Catacombs"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/ravenloft-catacombs.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":950000,"name":"K15 Chapel","type":"image","_id":"hthfLq8jz6IV7aj7","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Chapel"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/ravenloft-chapel.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":925000,"name":"K10 Dining Hall","type":"image","_id":"HjT0UNzgQwLGF7wq","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Dining Hall"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/ravenloft-dininghall.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1400000,"name":"K88 Tomb of King Barov & Quenn Ravenovia","type":"image","_id":"3Jl8afq4yG5HYOwu","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/ravenloft-tomb-kingbarov-queenravenovia.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1350000,"name":"K85 Sergei's Tomb","type":"image","_id":"6nikCm5Yy8mDxd5j","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Sergei's Tomb"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/sergei-tomb.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1375000,"name":"K86 Strahd's Tomb","type":"image","_id":"KY1C5oEoYNLTbXAv","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Strahd's Tomb"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/strahds-tomb.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1150000,"name":"K37 Study","type":"image","_id":"gRYxr7tSCmk1678K","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{"caption":"Study"},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/artwork/ravenloft-study.webp","system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1677352300305,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"nvUBCs7RENz5Czr1","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

Without the riding crop of mortality, time listlessly trudges on. Hunger is the only urgency left to me, and the pain of loss. So great is my heart of sorrow that it has manifested physical form. It is a numbing cold that shields me from the world of the living; nothing can injure me so deeply as my love for her, though many have tried. </p>\n<p>Oh, how they have tried to kill me. Self-styled heroes with their sharpened sticks and misplaced piety, how pitiable their fates! Traitors, priests, assassins, peasant uprisings, and even powerful wizards have perished within the walls of Ravenloft, a fitting punishment for their futile and clumsy attempts on my life. I have little need to prowl the land when my table is set with a feast of fools! No one, with all of their hatred, their schemes, or their clever plots, has given me any cause to fear in all the years of my unlife. </p>\n<p>As I ponder the nature of my eternity within these mists, bound to the land in more ways than one, I know that none may ever read these words.

I must count my blessings that he gave the weapon to my brother and not his wife. “Saint” Markovia was a worthy adversary without also wielding the perfect weapon to kill me. </p>\n<p>Enough! I linger on these pages, reluctant to resign them to the shelves to never again be read, but I must.

They came with a younger brother of mine, Sergei. He was handsome and youthful. I hated him for both…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The words meld and your voice fades away as darkness begins to overtake you, drawing you into something… more…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I had not seen my younger brother since I had left to join the armies, and he had been but an infant at the time. I do not know what I expected when I called for him to join me in taking this new birthright, but it was not the beautiful young man who filled every room with light as he entered it. It is odd that I think only of light and happiness when I consider Sergei, for when I first met him properly, his face was stained with tears. My mother had grown ill on the journey, her life threatenend by a powerful undead. Neither of my parents lived to enjoy the lands I built and named for them, neither lived to see what would become their tombs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd standing in all black, somberly receiving his brother’s retinue, Sergei helping to carry the coffin that bears his mother. He is young and handsome, looking similar to Strahd, but without any of the age or weight that war brought to the elder. Amongst Sergei’s retinue is a dwarf in fine standing, though it is unclear what his role is. Sergei comes to Strahd and with tears on his face openly embraces the other man, not seeming to care for protocol. Strahd stiffens and seems unsure, but after a moment he seems to relax and melt into the gesture, hugging his brother back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sergei was full of life, the epitome of youth. He was completely honest, unable to keep any emotion off of his face. He did not think to consider his options before acting; he threw himself into everything he did with all of his heart as soon as he impulsively decided to do it. He sparred with me and my men and was victorious against all but the most skilled, his raw strength and resilience shining through. I hated him for his youth, for his beauty, for the ease with which he walked through life, but… You could not help but love Sergei. He opened himself up to you, cared about you entirely, leaving nothing of himself behind. Just as I envied him for all that he had in front of him and was jealous of how he could be so wonderful, I loved him for all these things as well. He made me laugh, brought me out of my dark moods. Sergei made Barovia more beautiful than it had been before. He was the sun and we were all the flowers and trees that drank from his presence. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as the months pass and Strahd watches his brother enviously, but also smiles whenever Sergei turns his attention to him. There are many moments where you watch the two of them spar, and ride horses together, and spend evening drinking and laughing into the night. You see Strahd happier than he ever seems to have been before. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sergei was more than just the sun, truly he even wielded sunlight itself. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Sergei unsheathes his sword and you have never seen its like before. It is crystalline with veins of mithril woven through it, and it seems to reflect the sunlight and capture it, making the blade glow like the sun itself. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The months passed, and Sergei kept going into the villages, hoping to help the less fortunate, despite my concerns otherwise. Would the rest of the village decide to pay all of their taxes if they saw the money they gave up being squandered on those who did not work or contribute? Sergei always dismissed my concerns, and it was on one of these trips that he brought her back. When I first saw her, the world stopped and I knew I would never again be the same. My love for Sergei was like a man who had only known a lake now seeing the ocean for the first time. Sergei had been a bright star in the sky and I now saw the sun rise for the time in my life. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Strahd stands impatiently in the courtyard, ready to begin yelling at Sergei once more, when a woman emerges from the carriage. Her dress is a plain soft blue, her composure seeming to be overwhelmed. As you stare at her, taken about by her blood red auburn hair and beautiful soft features, you feel your stomach plummet. You watch Ireena exit the carriage. It is not a woman who looks similar to Ireena or possibly an ancestor; this woman is identical to Ireena, except that she appears to be somewhat poor and from one of Strahd’s older memories. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She was beyond beauty as a river in spring flood was to a drop of water, her spirit shining with her strength and goodness. She was called “perfection” and “joy” and “treasure”. Her name was Tatyana and I longed for her to be mine. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The woman, this Tatyana, approaches Strahd and curtsies, seeming awestruck by the castle and everything around her. She rises and smiles up at Strahd, and everything around her fades away. She is beautiful in that moment, her expression open and happy, excited and full of life, her eyes deep and captivating, drawing you in. For a moment the whole world stops and all that is or ever will be is this happy, content smile from this beautiful woman. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I loved her with all my heart. I loved her for her youth. I loved her for her joy. She was sky and earth, air and music, like sunlight without shadow. She was intelligent, brilliant even, grasping complex ideas and theories despite not being educated in the village. She made time to make food for all the others, the servants and the lords alike. She genuinely cared for everyone, allowing her light to spread out to all of them. She cared for particular plants and small animals, caring for each just the same as she did for everyone. Her smile was like that first glimpse of a sun after a bitter winter. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Tatyana spends hours in the castle, amongst the villagers, helping everyone wherever she can. She brings food to those who are hungry, tends to plants carefully and even cares for some children who have fallen ill. You watch all of these moments, the world always slightly hazy around Tatyana, everything seeming to be framed around her. You watch as she is genuinely happy, caring for everything around her with the same compassion that radiates from her core. Without warning, you watch as Sergei slips into the scene and places a hand on her back and she looks up at him, with love in her eyes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And then she looked at Sergei. It was if the sun that had favored me had been all along hidden by a cloud. Its brilliant glory now shone in full upon him… and him alone. She was blinded by the beauty and youth that my brother radiated. She could not see how lesser he was compared to her. She was swayed by his honeyed words and his foolish antics. She was a queen above all others, she deserved to be with someone who saw all that I did in her, but instead she was fooled by a man who could barely understand the logistics of how the castle ran, let alone a kingdom. She was seduced by a fool who would fade away to nothing in a few short years, who would betray her and seek out more to feel youthful again, just as our father had. She did not see what I could give her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch months of Tatyana giggling at things Sergei says, shaking her head amusedly whenever he does something silly. She cannot look away from him, blushing whenever he catches her watching him. You watch as she has to explain things to him in a patient manner, and you watch as they argue when he does something dangerous without telling her first. However, you see her gaze shifts whenever she sees Sergei, she seems to relax whenever he is around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With words she called me “brother”, but when I looked into her eyes, they reflected another name: “death”. It was the death of the aged that she saw in me. She loved her youth and enjoyed it. But I had squandered mine. It was the death that she saw in me that turned her from me; had I been young and full of life as Sergei was, she would have seen how I was the better option. She would have known what I could give her above him. He was but a foolish boy, I was a true man. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as the day of Sergei and Tatyana’s wedding approaches. More and more she looks away from Strahd when they are talking to look over at her betrothed. And you see how Strahd sees this and glares. You watch him stare at his hand that has veins and lines on it compared to her smooth unworried skin and glare and grind his teeth. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I came to hate death – my death. My squandered youth was everything now. I was dying, I could feel it with every step I took, every breath I heaved, every beat of my traitorous heart. I decided to act. I am not merely some petty warlord. I had conquered far greater things than simply death. I had killed one of the ancient wyrms, I had conquered the land itself, I was a powerful wizard. I could overcome something as petty as death. And so I returned to those dark halls, and tore apart its secrets, made the pact with death. A pact of powerful blood magics.</p>\n<p>On the day of their wedding, I came to Sergei, I offered him my hand and called him brother. I stared into his eyes, loving him and hating him in equal measure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd speaking with Sergei in his room, Sergei nervous for his wedding. He smiles up at his brother but that smile turns to a grimace of pain as Strahd plunges a knife into his heart. He stares up, uncomprehending as the light fades form his eyes, and Strahd, with tears streaming down his face, pulls the dagger out from his brother’s corpse. He speaks some words you cannot hear as he takes his brother’s blood and draws sigils on himself. He then licks his brother’s blood off of the knife and incants something to seemingly complete the ritual. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On that day I defeated death, made sure I would never age again. I became immune to death’s grasp. It was a pact sealed by the blood of a man I loved more than anything else. But with this newfound power, I knew I could make Tatyana mine, I could make her understand. She would see me now for what I was, she would see how I had always been the better choice. She would finally love me. </p>\n<p>I found her weeping in the garden east of the chapel. Word had already reached her of my brother’s demise, and she was lost to despair. I came to her and comforted her, told her how life was cruel in the worst of ways. I held her in my arms for the first time and everything was perfect. As I leaned down to kiss her, she broke free from my grasp and fled from me. She would not let me explain, she simply ran from me. She was confused, still in grief. I felt a great anger in me as I ran after her, she had to understand the pact that I had made for her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You watch as Tatyana runs from Strahd in her wedding gown, crimson staining the top of her dress where Strahd’s lips had made contact. Strahd chases her, calling for her to slow down, yelling that he can explain. She turns and looks back at him, her eyes filled with horror and disgust and worst of all, pity. She sees him coming closer and looks at the ledge she finds herself beside. You watch her steel herself and she doesn’t look back as she climbs the ledge and jumps from the height of the castle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In her despair, she flung herself from the walls of Ravenloft and in that moment, I watched everything I ever wanted fall from my grasp, forever. Time seemed to stand still as I screamed her name and rushed to the edge, where my love had disappeared. It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found. Not even I know her final fate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You see Strahd staring down at the mists in horror, uncomprehending, tears streaming down his face as he screams for Tatyana. Without warning, you watch as crossbow bolts hit his body from behind. You see that it seems like the castle had heard what Strahd has done and some of the guards are either trying to perform a coup or kill Strahd before he hurts anyone else or becomes something worse. <br />The scene begins to fade away to darkness, and once more you hear your companion reading the final translated words aloud, their voice merging with Strahd’s.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arrows from the castle guards pierced me to my soul, but I did not die. Nor did I live. I became undead, forever…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"10WF2TXgktTvDQ4l","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672519521344,"modifiedTime":1672519521344,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"r3NmvVmfJpWuUeXD","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

The dragon didn’t lair in the valley solely because of its idyllic beauty. He knew of a place called the Amber Temple — a repository of evil power guarded by the forces of good.

Dragon Statue</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Perched atop a ten-foot-wide, ten-foot-high cube of granite is a moss-covered statue of a dragon, its wings tucked close to its body. The statue looks east, toward the mansion.</p></aside><p>The fog makes it hard to see the dragon’s features from a distance, but close inspection reveals that it’s a silver dragon of noble bearing, its spiny frill cracked and broken in many places. The statue is 10 feet tall but looks much more imposing perched on the granite block.</p><p>If scrutinized with a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.85bGfZIw44zRuaWt]{detect magic} spell, the statue radiates an aura of evocation magic. The dragon statue used to breathe a cone of cold as part of a magic trap, but the trap no longer works (see @UUID[.YSJfJuKWFN0vOTEd#q2.-main-entrance]{area Q2}).</p><h3>Q2. Main Entrance</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Flagstone steps flanked by stone railings climb to a landing in front of a pair of tall, wooden doors with rusted iron bands and knockers shaped like small dragons. Carved into the lintel above the entrance is the word Argynvostholt.</p></aside><p>If a creature climbs the steps or sets foot on the landing, the dragon statue (@UUID[.YSJfJuKWFN0vOTEd#q1.-dragon-statue]{area Q1}) opens its mouth and exhales a 60-foot cone of harmless cold air, then closes its mouth and doesn’t activate again until the next dawn. At one time, the statue would breathe a cone of ice and hail, but its magic has deteriorated over the years.</p><p>The doors are unlocked and can be pushed open to reveal a dark foyer (@UUID[.YSJfJuKWFN0vOTEd#q3.-dragons-foyer]{area Q3}).</p><h3>Q3. Dragon’s Foyer</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This room feels like a king’s tomb. A grand staircase leads up to stone balconies held aloft by stone pillars and arches. A tall, faded tapestry depicting a nobleman in silver armor hangs from an iron rod above the staircase landing.</p><p>Six sets of double doors lead from this foyer. Along the walls, displayed on marble pedestals, are three alabaster busts of handsome men. A fourth bust and its pedestal have been knocked over, and their shattered remains lie strewn across the mosaic floor. Two chandeliers of wrought iron hang from the ceiling like monstrous black spiders.</p></aside><p>The tapestry is torn in places and worthless. It is a portrait of Lord Argynvost. The alabaster busts depict several of the dragon’s other human guises. The stairs lead up to the second-floor balconies (area Q18).</p><h4>Shadow of Argynvost</h4><p>The first time the characters pass through this foyer, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A great shadow with wings moves across the walls and disappears. You hear the soft bestial hiss in the darkness.</p></aside><p>The draconic shadow is ominous yet harmless.</p><h3>Q4. Spiders’ Ballroom</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Rubble is strewn throughout much of this vast chamber, caused by the partial collapse of the rooms above it. On the pink marble floor, fallen chandeliers lie amid broken chairs and other furnishings. Thick webs stretch from wall to wall, and moving among them are too many giant spiders to count!</p></aside><p>Nine giant spiders nest here. They attack anyone who gets too close.</p><h3>Q5. Ruined Stable</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Here lie the blackened beams of a wooden stable, burned to its stone foundation. Looming above the wreckage is the partially collapsed south end of the mansion, all three of its floors exposed to the elements.</p></aside><p>There is nothing of value in the stable.</p><h3>Q6. Dragon’s Den</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This wood-paneled den has been ransacked, its furnishings tossed about. A cold, dark hearth dominates the west wall between two narrow windows. Standing upright against the north wall is a sarcophagus made of black wood with a queen’s effigy carved into its lid.</p></aside><p>Argynvost had the empty sarcophagus converted into a wine cabinet. Now, only shattered wineglasses and decanters are to be found on the shelves. The den’s other furnishings include rotted divans, broken chairs, overturned ottomans, and smashed oil lamps.</p><p>A secret door at the north end of the east wall can be pushed open to reveal a storage room (area Q11).</p><h4>Living Fire</h4><p>If the beacon of Argynvostholt (area Q53) has not been lit, read the following text when the characters approach the fireplace for the first time:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A fire erupts in the dead hearth and assumes a draconic form. It hisses, crackles, and unfurls its smoky wings.</p></aside><p>Have the player characters roll initiative. The fire acts on initiative count 10 and has AC 15, 1 hit point, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes and fills the room with fire, setting fire to the dry furnishings. Each creature in the room must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The fire doesn’t attack. On its first turn, if it has not been reduced to 0 hit points, it speaks:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The fiery dragon hisses as it addresses you. “My knights have fallen into darkness. Save them if you can. Show them the light they have lost!” With that, the fire burns out.</p></aside><p>The dragon refers to the Order of the Silver Dragon and the beacon (area Q53).</p><h3>Q7. Parlor</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Tattered velvet drapes cover the tall, slender windows that encircle this parlor. The furnishings are covered with dust and cobwebs, and lie in disarray. A damaged brass chandelier hangs from the ceiling, which is covered with a faded mural that depicts metallic dragons and colorful birds flying beneath white clouds.</p></aside><p>Time and neglect have damaged the furnishings, leaving nothing of value.</p><h3>Q8. Iron Gate</h3><p>An iron gate, chained shut, closes off a 10-foot-tall archway on the north wall of the mansion. The key to the chain’s padlock was lost long ago, but the lock can be picked by someone who uses thieves’ tools and makes a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The old lock can be smashed by a character who uses a bludgeoning or slashing weapon on it and makes a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p><p>Ten-foot-high flights of stone steps to the west and east of the archway lead up to landings and doors that provide access to areas @UUID[.YSJfJuKWFN0vOTEd#q7.-parlor]{Q7} and @UUID[.YSJfJuKWFN0vOTEd#q9.-servants-quarters]{Q9}.</p><h3>Q9. Servants’ Quarters</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Tattered brown drapes cover the windows of this circular room, and a heavy curtain hangs across an archway to the south. Strewn about the floor is the wreckage of half a dozen beds and other pieces of furniture.</p></aside><p>Lord Argynvost’s household staff once slept here. The room contains nothing of value.

Kitchen</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This kitchen has been plundered, its tables overturned. The floor is littered with rusted utensils and smashed crockery. Narrow windows flanking a hearth look out over a cemetery. An open iron pot hangs from a hook inside the blackened fireplace. It rattles on its hook and bobs up and down, as though something is inside it.</p></aside><p>The iron pot contains an ordinary @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.3q11HVjZqDkMf1pK]{bat}. When the characters get close, it flies out and flaps about the room.</p><h3>Q11. Wine Storage</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Five barrels lie in wooden braces along the walls of this dark, moldy storage room.</p></aside><p>Hiding behind the barrels is a wounded elf named <strong>Savid</strong> (N male dusk elf @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.H0OrmGfHHU2VIVgy]{scout}). He has 4 hit points remaining and is grateful for any healing the characters can provide.</p><p>Savid lives with the other dusk elves of Barovia in the Vistani camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9). He was searching the woods for a missing Vistani girl named Arabelle when a wandering mob of needle blights accosted him. He was forced to take refuge in the mansion.</p><p>Savid, who is more than four hundred years old, volunteers the following useful information:</p><ul><li><p>Argynvost was a silver dragon that liked to assume human forms. Argynvostholt was the dragon’s home.</p></li><li><p>In human guise, the noble dragon led a group of knights called the Order of the Silver Dragon. They gave shelter to refugees who had come to the valley to escape Strahd’s army. Strahd’s soldiers slew the dragon, destroyed the order, and sacked the mansion.</p></li><li><p>Vistani and dusk elves avoid the mansion, believing that the dragon’s ghost haunts it.</p></li></ul><p>The wine in the barrels turned to vinegar and evaporated long ago. Emblazoned on the barrels’ sides are the name of the winery, the Wizard of Wines, and the name of the wine, Champagne du le Stomp.</p><p>A secret door at the north end of the west wall can be pulled open to reveal a den (@UUID[.YSJfJuKWFN0vOTEd#q6.-dragons-den]{area Q6}).</p><h3>Q12. Dining Hall</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A twenty-foot-long table with sculpted dragons for legs stands in the center of this hall. The chairs that surround the table have backs carved to resemble folded dragon wings, and several of the chairs have been overturned or smashed to pieces. Suspended above the table is a crystal chandelier that glows with a soft white light. Standing in windowed alcoves are two life-sized statues depicting knights with dragon-winged helms and shields.</p><p>Rainwater trickles through cracks in the ceiling, flowing down the west wall and adding to a large puddle on the floor.</p><p>Five sets of wooden doors lead to this hall. The doors in the northeast corner hang open. A pair of leaded glass doors, their panes cracked and broken, stand open between panels of stained glass set into the east wall. These panels depict silver dragons in flight. Beyond the glass doors lies a dark, misty room that appears to be a chapel.</p></aside><p>A @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.R2Lm8fIVqqW8oxt5]{continual flame} spell was cast on the crystal chandelier long ago and has never been dispelled. The knight statues are lifelike but inanimate.</p><h3>Q13. Chapel of Morning</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Cracked wooden pillars support a wooden, U-shaped balcony that overhangs this stone-walled chapel. Narrow archways lead to spiral staircases that curl up to the balcony, and a door set into the north wall has a wooden beam barring it. At the east end of the chapel rests a stone altar flanked by iron candelabras. The altar is carved with a rising sun bas-relief. Tall, arching windows set with panels of stained glass decorate the walls behind the altar. One of the windows has been shattered, covering the chapel floor with shards of colored glass and allowing thick fog to enter and fill the room.</p></aside><p>If the beacon has not been lit (see areas @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q16.-dragons-mausoleum]{Q16} and Q53), add:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Through the fog, you see three armored figures kneeling before the altar.</p></aside><p>The figures are three @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.NYtfCTtgz5o7AEaf]{revenants} clad in tattered chain mail that affords the same protection as leather armor. Each revenant wields a longsword. If the beacon is lit, the revenants are cleansed of their hatred and laid to rest, and the characters find three armored corpses with longswords lying on the floor in front of the altar.</p><p>The revenants, if still active, are blinded by their hate and attack the characters on sight, seeking to drive them out of Argynvostholt. As an action, a revenant attacks twice with its longsword, wielding the weapon with both hands and dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage on a hit.</p><p>Characters who study the room’s iconography and orientation (the fact that it draws light from the east) can determine, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check, that the chapel is dedicated to a god of the dawn. Anyone familiar with Barovian religion can conclude that the god in question is the Morninglord.</p><p>The balcony (area Q24) is 20 feet high and can be reached by climbing either spiral staircase (area @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q14.-chapel-staircases]{Q14}).</p><p>Characters who stand near the altar and look up can see the hollow interior of the beacon tower. The tower’s lower landing (area Q50) is 60 feet above the chapel floor, and the upper landing (area Q51) is another 20 feet above that.</p><p>The bar across the north door is easily lifted from this side. Once the bar is removed, the door can be pulled open to reveal a stone staircase leading down to a cemetery (area @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q15.-cemetery]{Q15}).</p><h3>Q14. Chapel Staircases</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Narrow windows allow dim light to enter this five-foot-wide spiral staircase.</p></aside><p>The staircase leads from the chapel (area @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q13.-chapel-of-morning]{Q13}) to the chapel’s balcony (area Q24) and climbs another 20 feet to a small, empty room with a window that looks down on the chapel.</p><h3>Q15. Cemetery</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Tucked behind the mansion is a fog-shrouded cemetery enclosed by a seven-foot-tall fence of wrought iron. In the northeast corner stands a mausoleum.</p></aside><p>If the beacon has not been lit (see areas @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q16.-dragons-mausoleum]{Q16} and Q53), read the following text when the characters cross the cemetery for the first time:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You suddenly feel like someone or something is watching you. Looking up, you spot a well-dressed man with a thick mane of thistledown hair observing you from a high tower window. He draws the curtain and disappears from view.</p></aside><p>The strange man watches the characters through the southeast window of area Q42. He is merely an apparition intended to lure the characters to that room.</p><p>The mausoleum is described in area @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q16.-dragons-mausoleum]{Q16}.</p><p>The thick fog obscures the fact that five of the graves have been dug up. Closer inspection and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the corpses buried there crawled out of the earth. Of the missing corpses there is no sign, but the surrounding fence is intact, which suggests that no one got into the cemetery from outside. (These corpses were animated by the spirits of revenants and clawed their way out.)</p><p>A stone staircase curls up the outside of a turret to a flagstone landing in front of a sturdy wooden door. The door is barred from the inside and opens into the chapel (area @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q13.-chapel-of-morning]{Q13}).</p><h3>Q16. Dragon’s Mausoleum</h3><p>Tarnished, silver-plated gargoyles shaped like dragon wyrmlings cling to the stone-tiled roof of this mausoleum. An eight-foot-tall, four-foot-wide white marble door set into the southwest wall is engraved with a name: Argynvost.</p><p>The dragon-shaped gargoyles are harmless statuary. The stone door can be pulled open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The interior of the mausoleum is dark and dusty. You see four empty alcoves with raised floors. Etched into the far wall is a verse written in Draconic.</p></aside><p>Characters who can read the Draconic script can decipher the writing on the wall:</p><aside class=\"epigraph\"><p>Here lie the bones and treasures of<br />Argynvost, lord of Argynvostholt and<br />founder of the Order of the Silver Dragon.</p></aside><h4>Development</h4><p>If the skull of Argynvost is brought from Castle Ravenloft (see chapter 4, area K67) and sealed inside the mausoleum, the dragon’s spirit transforms into a brilliant light at the top of the tower (see area Q53).</p><h3>Q17. West Staircases</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Narrow windows illuminate this dusty, five-foot-wide spiral staircase.</p></aside><p>These staircases connect the second-floor balconies (area @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q18.-balconies]{Q18}) to areas Q30 and Q36 on the third floor.</p><h3>Q18. Balconies</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Two stone balconies flank the main foyer. Balusters carved to resemble knights in shining armor support their elegantly carved stone railings. Weapons and shields festoon the walls along each of these walkways, while alabaster busts of handsome men flank hallways that lead north and south away from the foyer. At the west end of each balcony is an archway that leads to a spiral staircase going up.</p></aside><p>The balcony is 20 feet above the floor of the foyer (area @UUID[.YSJfJuKWFN0vOTEd#q3.-dragons-foyer]{Q3}). The weapons and shields hanging on the walls are nonmagical. The busts, displayed atop wooden pedestals, depict various human guises of the dragon Argynvost. Their eyes seem to watch the characters as they walk by, but the effect is an optical illusion.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz"},{"sort":200000,"name":"Areas of Argynvostholt (Q19 - Q27)","type":"text","_id":"oqV2lE2gmlpMRY6B","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>Q19.

A few furnishings lie broken under fallen debris from the level above.</p></aside><p>The wooden floor creaks underfoot. Although it is safe to walk on, doing so attracts the giant spiders from area Q4. The spiders crawl up into the room and attack. The floor here is 20 feet above the floor of the ballroom.</p><h3>Q20. South Alcove</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A red velvet curtain hangs in front of an alcove in the southeast corner of this hall. It ripples ever so slightly.</p></aside><p>One of the narrow windows in the back of the alcove has a broken glass pane through which a slight breeze passes, causing the curtain to move. When the characters look behind the curtain, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A black cloth covers something atop a white marble pedestal.</p></aside><p>Beneath the black cloth is the severed head of a randomly determined character — an illusion created by Strahd’s consciousness. In actuality, it’s an exquisite alabaster bust of a handsome, middle-aged human with a neatly trimmed mustache and beard (Lord Argynvost). The illusion is too strong to be disbelieved, but it can be dispelled if the bust is broken or covered up again.</p><h3>Q21. North Alcove</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A red velvet curtain hangs in front of an alcove in the northeast corner of this hall.</p></aside><p>The alcove is empty except for the narrow windows in the back walls. Whenever the characters part the curtain and leave, the curtain is closed when they return. Only by removing the curtain from its rod can they prevent the curtain from closing on its own.</p><h3>Q22. Bathroom</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The room contains an iron tub and has wood paneling on the walls that rises to a height of three feet. Above the paneling, the walls are painted with a continuous, faded mural of a mountainscape.</p></aside><p>The mural accurately depicts the Balinok Mountains.</p><h3>Q23. Storage Room</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Rainwater seeps through cracks in the ceiling and flows into a pool on the sagging wooden floor. The pool fills about half the room. Bare stone shelves line the walls.</p></aside><p>This room has been thoroughly looted. The wooden floor is soft and spongy, and it can’t support more than 100 pounds of weight. If more weight is applied, the floor collapses, and any creature in the room falls 20 feet, taking damage as normal and landing in area Q12.</p><h3>Q24. Chapel Balcony</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This wooden balcony overhangs the mansion’s chapel. An exquisitely carved wooden throne rests at the west end between two doors, and narrow archways lead to spiral staircases going up and down. Hanging from the high ceiling is an iron chandelier with candle holders shaped like tiny silver dragons.</p></aside><p>The doors behind the throne lead to areas Q20 and Q21. A wooden railing surrounds the balcony, which is 20 feet above the floor of the chapel (area Q13).</p><h3>Q25. Trapped Hallway</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This T-shaped hallway has branches to the west, east, and south. Three arched windows in the north wall look out over the foggy grounds.</p></aside><p>The ceiling in the hall is 20 feet high. The wooden doors to areas Q27 and Q28 are locked, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to break down. The 10-foot squares in front of the doors (marked T on the map) are trapped. When a character enters one of these squares, a floor-to-ceiling wall of stone (created by the spell of the same name) magically appears across the opening on the south wall. At the same time, the @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.LqOf4NyJ39862GOp]{phantom warriors} in areas Q27 and Q28 rush through the doors (which can be freely opened from their side) and attack.</p><p>The wall of stone vanishes after 10 minutes, at which time the trap resets. Characters who cast a detect magic spell in the hall can perceive hazy auras of evocation magic in front of the doors.</p><h3>Q26. Northeast Guest Room</h3><p>The door to this room hangs open.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Two beds with torn canopies stand against opposite walls with a tattered rug lying on the floor between them.

Dragon’s Audience Hall</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The west wall of this fifty-foot-long, thirty-foot-wide audience hall has crumbled, leaving a gaping hole and a pile of rubble. Weapons and shields that once hung from the walls have fallen to the floor and succumbed to rust. A large, wooden throne carved to resemble a dragon with unfolding wings faces three tall windows to the west. Slumped in the throne is a gaunt, armored figure with one gauntlet wrapped around the hilt of a greatsword.</p></aside><p>@UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.I3c99tXFZ4mUX7fQ]{Vladimir Horngaard} , commander of the fallen Order of the Silver Dragon, is slumped in the throne. If the beacon of Argynvostholt (see area Q53) has been lit, the corpse is lifeless, and characters can plunder it freely (see “Treasure” below).</p><p>If the beacon has not been lit, the body is serving as a host for the revenant. If the characters approach it, it says, “Go away.” If they don’t leave immediately, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The creature’s grip on the greatsword tightens. “If you have come to destroy me, know this: I perished defending this land from evil over four centuries ago, and because of my failure, I am forever doomed. If you destroy this body, my spirit will find a new corpse to inhabit, and I will hunt you down. You cannot free me from my damnation, nor would I wish it.\"</p><p>“If you have come to free this land from the creature that feasts on the blood of the innocent, know this: There is no monster I hate more than Strahd von Zarovich. He slew Argynvost, broke the life of the knight I loved, and destroyed the valiant order to which I devoted my life, but Strahd has already died once. He can’t be allowed to die again. Instead, he must suffer eternally in a hell of his own creation, from which he can never escape. Whatever can be done to bring him misery and unrest, I will do, but I will destroy anyone who tries to end his torment.”</p></aside><p>Vladimir fights in self-defense. He also rises from his throne and attacks if the characters fail to heed his warning and press him for help destroying Strahd. The first time Vladimir takes damage, six phantom warriors (see appendix D) materialize and join the fray, coming to his defense.</p><p>Hatred so clouds Vladimir’s mind that he can’t remember that Sir Godfrey (area Q37) was his beloved in life. If Sir Godfrey helps the characters and faces Vladimir, anguished recognition shines in Vladimir’s eyes, yet only lighting the beacon can free him.</p><h4>Treasure</h4><p>Vladimir Horngaard wields a +2 greatsword.</p><p>Vladimir wears a platinum holy symbol of the Morninglord (worth 250 gp) around his neck, underneath his half plate armor.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s in Vladimir’s possession, and he doesn’t part with it willingly unless the beacon of Argynvostholt has been lit (see area Q53).</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Areas of Argynvostholt (Q37 - Q45)","type":"text","_id":"5hULprGfUpPvd54s","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>Q37. Knights of the Order</h3><p>The leaders of the Order of the Silver Dragon used to convene here.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Through the dust and cobwebs, you see faded war banners adorning the walls of a spacious chamber, in the center of which stands a heavy wooden table. An iron chandelier hangs above the table, which is surrounded by six high-backed chairs with wood-carved dragons perched atop them. Slumped in five of the chairs are skeletal humans in tattered chainmail.</p></aside><p>If the beacon in area @UUID[.YragVkfPas3Jy9rE#q53.-beacon-of-argynvostholt]{Q53} has been lit, the spirits of these revenants are laid to rest, leaving behind their inanimate corpses. If the beacon has not been lit, add the following:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The corpses tilt their heads in your direction. One of them growls, “Why do you the living disturb the dead?”</p></aside><p>The skeletal figures are five @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.NYtfCTtgz5o7AEaf]{revenants}. All five are lawful evil. They are awaiting orders from Vladimir (area @UUID[.1DMeuTL7wxJMoBNC#q36.-dragons-audience-hall]{Q36}) and fight only in self-defense. The revenants wear broken chainmail that affords as much protection as leather armor, and they wield longswords. As an action, a revenant attacks twice with its longsword, wielding the weapon with both hands and dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage on a hit.</p><p>One of the revenants, @UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.actors.YZgC8E3XUzMPaTm0]{Sir Godfrey Gwilym}, is a spellcaster with a challenge rating of 6 (2,300 XP) and the following additional feature:</p><p><strong>Spellcasting</strong>. Sir Godfrey is a 16th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14). Sir Godfrey has the following paladin spells prepared:</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p>1st level (4 slots): command, divine favor, thunderous smite</p><p>2nd level (3 slots): branding smite, magic weapon</p><p>3rd level (3 slots): blinding smite, dispel magic</p><p>4th level (2 slots): staggering smite</p></aside><p>Characters who inspect the fireplace notice a shield-shaped patch on the wall above the mantelpiece. A magic shield once hung above the fireplace, but it was taken when Strahd’s soldiers plundered the mansion. It now rests in Castle Ravenloft’s treasury (chapter 4, area K41).</p><h4>Development</h4><p>Sir Godfrey can sense that the spirit of Argynvost isn’t at rest and isn’t happy that the order has been reduced to such a state. If the characters petition the revenants for aid, Sir Godfrey (speaking in a scratchy voice) relates all the information presented at the start of the chapter concerning Argynvost and the rise and fall of the Order of the Silver Dragon. Neither he nor the other revenants can help the characters in any meaningful way, however, because of the oaths they have sworn to Vladimir Horngaard.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that Sir Godfrey is Strahd’s enemy and the characters persuasively ask him for help, he offers to join the fight against the vampire. Fate has unlocked his memory of the love that he and Vladimir once shared, and the power of that memory drives Godfrey to help fight Strahd and restore the order’s honor.</p><p>If the beacon in area @UUID[.YragVkfPas3Jy9rE#q53.-beacon-of-argynvostholt]{Q53}has not been lit, Godfrey’s decision incurs the wrath of the other revenants, triggering an armed conflict.</p><p>If the beacon in area @UUID[.YragVkfPas3Jy9rE#q53.-beacon-of-argynvostholt]{Q53} has been lit, Sir Godfrey remains a revenant even after all the other revenants (including Vladimir) are laid to rest, except that his alignment changes to lawful good. Although Sir Godfrey is unaware of the tarokka card reading, he somehow senses that he must perform one final task before his spirit can rest with Vladimir’s, and thus he agrees to help the characters face Strahd in Castle Ravenloft.</p><h3>Q38. Closet</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This dusty closet has a slender window set into the north wall. The room is otherwise empty.</p></aside><h3>Q39. Vladimir’s Bedroom</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Light enters this circular room through five cracked windows. The light falls on a large, dust-covered bed in the center of the room, its posts topped with wood-carved dragons. Two large animals flank the double doors. One is a brown bear standing on its hind legs, its claws outstretched. The other is a dire wolf, its face frozen in an evil snarl. Near the wolf lies an empty wooden chest.</p></aside><p>This room once served as a bedchamber for Sir Vladimir Horngaard and Sir Godfrey Gwilym. The bear and the dire wolf are stuffed and harmless. Looters ransacked the chest long ago, leaving nothing of value.</p><h3>Q40. Argynvost’s Study</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>This room is a haven for dust and cobwebs. Three narrow windows allow slivers of light to illuminate bare oak shelves along the walls and a torn, padded chair lying on its side near a cavernous hearth. A picture above the mantel has been slashed, its lower half hanging down below the frame like a torn piece of flesh. An iron door set in the south corner of the west wall hangs open on one hinge.</p></aside><p>Strahd’s soldiers forced open the iron door that once sealed Argynvost’s vault (area Q41). They also took every book in this study but one. (Many of the books taken from here can be found in Strahd’s study in Castle Ravenloft.)</p><p>The sole remaining volume lies on the floor behind the overturned chair. Titled The Oath Celestial, the book has been partially burned, and its cover was slashed by a sword. Leafing through the crumbling book reveals that it is a devotional text for knights from a place called the Holy Empire of Valentia. Most of the knights who joined Argynvost against Strahd came from that empire — now lost beyond the mists.</p><h4>Journal Page</h4><p>As the characters cross the room, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>You hear the soft flapping sound of wings, but can’t discern its origin. A single piece of parchment blows off the top of a bookshelf, spirals lazily in the air, and lands gently at your feet.</p></aside><p>The sheet of parchment is the last page of Argynvost’s journal, the rest of which was destroyed. If the characters look at the torn page, show the players the “@UUID[Compendium.peas-curse-of-strahd.journals.KGENzBwDwZrofGAo]{Journal of Argynvost}”.</p><h4>Slashed Picture</h4><p>If the characters study the whole picture above the mantelpiece, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The picture shows the mansion in better days, under clear winter skies with snow-capped mountains in the background. The top of the chapel tower glows like a silver beacon.</p></aside><p>The picture radiates an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, but the aura is weak. If the characters repair the picture using a mending cantrip, read:</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The beacon in the picture flashes with a brilliant silver light, and the spectral form of a huge silver dragon fills the room. “My skull lies in the fortress of my enemy,” it says, “displayed in a place of ill omen. Return my skull to its rightful crypt, and my spirit will shine here forever, bringing hope to this dark land.” With that, the dragon’s apparition fades away.</p></aside><p>The spectral dragon isn’t the spirit of Argynvost, but a spell-like effect. Once the dragon has spoken, the picture no longer glows and becomes nonmagical.</p><h3>Q41. Dragon’s Vault</h3><p>The iron door leading to this room hangs open on a single rusty hinge. It has obviously been forced open and no longer closes properly.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The walls of this room are lined with lead. Emptied chests and shattered vases lie strewn upon the floor, their contents plundered.</p></aside><p>This vault once held a dragon’s trove but was stripped of all valuables long ago.</p><h3>Q42. Argynvost’s Bedroom</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Rich drapes, faded by time and neglect, hide the windows of this otherwise empty room.</p></aside><p>Argynvost preferred to sleep in his dragon form. Thus, there is no furniture here.</p><h3>Q43. Hole in Roof</h3><p>This 20-foot-diameter hole in the mansion’s roof is directly above area @UUID[.1DMeuTL7wxJMoBNC#q33.-collapsed-ceiling]{Q33}, the floor of which is 20 feet below. The rubble on the roof surrounding the hole is difficult terrain. The roof is sloped and covered with cracked stone tiles. Climbing the tiled roof requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. A failure by 5 or more causes the climber to slide down to the parapet, landing prone but taking no damage.</p><h3>Q44. Dragon Gargoyle</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Perched on the rooftop overlooking the parapet is a silver-plated gargoyle shaped like a dragon wyrmling.</p></aside><p>The silver dragon wyrmling statue is 10 feet above the parapet and has a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.item-9-spells.Hi9u9h7j5UyRla98]{magic mouth} spell cast on it. When a character passes in front of it, the spell is activated, and the wyrmling whispers the following short verse in the Common tongue:</p><p><em>When the dragon dreams its dream</em></p><p><em>Within its rightful tomb,</em></p><p><em>The light of Argynvost will beam</em></p><p><em>And rid this land of gloom.</em></p><h3>Q45.

Roof Turrets</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Cobwebs hang from the rafters of this turret, which is empty except for a wooden bench and an iron stove. Arrow slits look down upon the foggy grounds in front of the mansion.</p></aside><p>The knights who once guarded the rooftop used these turrets for warmth and shelter on rainy days and cold nights.</p><h3>Q48. Roof’s Edge</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Beyond a ragged edge of stone is a sixty-foot plunge to the rubble-strewn ground below. A few rafters stick out from beneath the stone.</p></aside><p>The edge of the roof is sturdy enough to walk on, and not in danger of further collapse. It’s 20 feet down to area @UUID[.1DMeuTL7wxJMoBNC#q32.-ruined-bedchambers]{Q32}, 40 feet down to area @UUID[.oqV2lE2gmlpMRY6B#q19.-ruined-bedchambers]{Q19}, and 60 feet down to area @UUID[.YSJfJuKWFN0vOTEd#q4.-spiders-ballroom]{Q4}.</p><h3>Q49. Beacon Tower Door</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>The parapet narrows to a width of ten feet, ending before a sturdy wooden door set into the wall of the eastern tower.</p></aside><p>This door is barred from the inside. The phantom warriors in the tower’s turrets (area @UUID[.YragVkfPas3Jy9rE#q52.-beacon-turrets]{Q52}) make ranged attacks against characters who try to force their way into the tower. These spectral defenders have three-quarters cover behind the arrow slits.</p><h3>Q50. Beacon, Lower Landing</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A rickety wooden landing and a staircase cling to the walls of this tower. The stairs lead up to another landing twenty feet above, and the floor of the chapel lies sixty feet below.</p></aside><p>The landing and the stairs creak and shudder underfoot, but they are safe.</p><h3>Q51. Beacon, Upper Landing</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Creaky stairs climb to a wooden landing with three windows that look out over the roof of the mansion. Flanking the windows are two narrow wooden doors.</p></aside><p>The landing creaks and groans underfoot, much like in area @UUID[.YragVkfPas3Jy9rE#q50.-beacon,-lower-landing]{Q50}, but here things aren’t so safe. The 10-foot-long section marked T on the map is particularly weak, collapsing under 50 or more pounds of weight. A creature on this section of the landing when it collapses must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet to the landing below (area @UUID[.YragVkfPas3Jy9rE#q50.-beacon,-lower-landing]{Q50}). The collapse of this section creates a 10-foot gap in the landing.</p><p>The doors lead to the rooftops of the turrets (area @UUID[.YragVkfPas3Jy9rE#q52.-beacon-turrets]{Q52}).</p><h3>Q52. Beacon Turrets</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>A stone battlement encloses the roof of this turret. A spiral staircase descends to the level below.</p></aside><p>These turret rooftops are 80 feet above ground level. The spiral stairs descend 20 feet to archers’ posts — small rooms lined with arrow slits. Standing guard in each of these rooms is a @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.LqOf4NyJ39862GOp]{phantom warrior} with a spectral longbow that shoots arrows of force energy. The two phantom warriors gain the following action options:</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The phantom warrior makes two attacks with its spectral longsword or spectral longbow.</p><p><strong>Spectral Longbow</strong>. Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d8) force damage.</p></aside><h3>Q53. Beacon of Argynvostholt</h3><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>Wooden stairs climb to the tower’s peak, which has a stone floor and a thirty-foot-high pitched roof. Ravens roost on crisscrossing rafters, coming and going through small holes in the roof. Ten-foot-high, five-foot-wide arched windows are evenly spaced around the walls. Each window consists of a lead latticework fitted with small panes of transparent glass.</p></aside><p>The @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-dnd-beyond-shared-content.actor-1-monsters.loEYmnm5GdoQ2HB7]{ravens} that roost here are harmless, but they watch the characters with great interest. If the characters look out the windows, you can use the following text to describe what they see in the distance.</p><aside class=\"read-aloud-text\"><p>To the north and east lies a mist-shrouded valley with dark woods, a small town, and a lonely windmill on a precipice. To the south, a river flows through a foggy marsh. To the west, between rocky hills, you glimpse an abbey perched on a snowy mountainside beyond a long stretch of fog-smothered pines.</p></aside><p>The small town is Vallaki (chapter 5). The windmill is Old Bonegrinder (chapter 6). The abbey is the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk (chapter 8).</p><h4>Lighting the Beacon</h4><p>When the skull of Argynvost is placed in the dragon’s mausoleum (area @UUID[.9oPWJyppKfCx3oXz#q16.-dragons-mausoleum]{Q16}), the dragon’s spirit transforms into a brilliant light that fills this room and flashes across the valley like the beacon of a lighthouse. Even if the tower is cast down, the light of Argynvost remains where it is, flashing in the sky. Although the mountains prevent the beacon’s light from reaching Castle Ravenloft directly, Strahd can see the light’s glow in the sky to the west.</p><p>The beacon can be seen in Vallaki (chapter 5), Krezk (chapter 8), and Berez (chapter 10), as well as from Old Bonegrinder (chapter 6), Van Richten’s Tower (chapter 11), and the werewolf den (chapter 15).</p><p>The beacon’s light can be “felt” even by creatures that are blind. The light allows good-aligned creatures to experience glimmers of hope and joy, while evil creatures find the light disconcerting.</p><p><em><strong>Beacon of Protection.</strong></em> While the beacon shines, characters and other creatures that oppose Strahd gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws for as long as they remain in Barovia.</p><p><em><strong>Revenants at Rest.</strong></em> Vladimir Horngaard and the other revenants that haunt Barovia see the light as a reminder of all that was once good and noble about the knightly order to which they once belonged. They let go of their hatred and their corporeal bodies, leaving corpses behind as their spirits find rest at long last. Henceforth, any random encounter with a revenant should be treated as no encounter.</p><h4>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h4><p>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s resting on the west windowsill.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1677352300856,"lastModifiedBy":"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB"},"_id":"rar8QnASBu6twop7","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Jd73bpddRreBTuIB":3}}

Our enemies forced us from our homes, and now we wander the lost roads.”</p>\n<p>The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.</p>\n<p>Stanimir continues. “One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn’t say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn’t give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves.”</p>\n<p>Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.</p>\n<p>“This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, ‘I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will always be safe here.’”</p>\n<p>The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.</p>\n<p>Stanimir’s face becomes a somber mask. “A curse has befallen our noble prince, turning him into a tyrant.

You see utter blackness, and feel a sense of calm in your mind.</p>\n<p>You notice a pinprick of light in the distance. You seem to be calmly floating toward it.</p>\n<p>As the light nears, you can see the figure of a hunched man, bent under an unseen weight. His wrists and ankles are wrapped in crimson red cords, and he otherwise seems to be clothed in rags. His features are blurred, and it pains your eyes to focus on his figure.</p>\n<p>He turns, and you feel his gaze upon you as a physical weight, measuring you and assessing you.  Silently, he turns from you.</p>\n<p>The light begins to fade, retreating from your view. At the same time, the blackness grows brighter, yielding a dim murky light. You can see the shapes of stone monuments, squat buildings and the smell of moldy earth begins to permeate your senses. Open graves form in the rocky earth before you, ancient mausoleums stand vigilant in your periphery. A thin reedy wheezing laugh languidly assaults your ears.</p>\n<p>“Bravo! Challenging that spineless oaf to a duel was utterly delightful.”  A familiar gaunt figure materializes before you: Tarakamedes, The Gravelord.</p>\n<p>“Couple of bandits and a Baron, huh?  Not all that great, really. I had higher hopes.  However, those criminals you left alive are marinating in their fear and despair, and I don’t suppose I’ll need to wait much longer to savor them. You get some credit for that.”</p>\n<p>“Since you didn’t follow our <em>Lord on the Rack </em>back there, I assume you’re not done with your mortal existence. I believe you have a few more faces to try on before you’re done, and I’m not quite ready to let you go – I see potential!  But, you’re still too fragile and brittle. I need you to stick around longer and free Souls from cursed mortals. Be the blessing to their cursed existence and free them to my realm – the afterlife!”</p>\n<p>He gazes at you intently – your very soul feels a cold so intense it burns. </p>\n<p>Slowly, a smile forms on his gaunt features, a twisted humorless smile. He gestures, and utters a few words from harsh language, and you feel your body pulse with strength.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You gain the <strong>Might of Tarakamedes</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While this boon is active, your Strength score changes to 21. The boon has no effect on you if your Strength without the blessing is equal to or greater than 21.  </li>\n<li>You permanently gain the following character flaw: “I am envious of my betters and cruel to my inferiors.” </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Use my blessings well, mortal. Go forth and liberate this land from the evil and the cursed. Purge those unworthy;  of the <em>Crying God’s</em> attentions. By serving me, you also serve Him.  Unlike Him, I see potential and reward service. Continue to shine and I shall raise you to ever increasing heights of power.”</p>\n<p>And he begins to laugh again while the light grows ever brighter, until it’s blinding.</p>\n<p>As the spots from your vision fade, you notice faint sounds of murmured conversations.
