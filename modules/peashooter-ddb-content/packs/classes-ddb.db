{"name":"Paladin","type":"class","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/DnDBeyond/images/class-icons/paladin.jpeg","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><h3>The Cause of Righteousness</h3><p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p><h3>Beyond the Mundane Life</h3><p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p><h3>Creating a Paladin</h3><p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? The Gods of the Multiverse section lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p><p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p><p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p><p>You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma.

Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p><p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p><p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.</p></aside><h3>Class Features</h3><p>As a paladin, you gain the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per paladin level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Atheletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion and Religion.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Equipment</p><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li><p>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</p></li><li><p>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</p></li><li><p>(a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</p></li><li><p>Chain mail and a holy symbol</p></li></ul><h3>Divine Sense</h3><p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p><h3>Lay on Hands</h3><p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.</p><p>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p><p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p><h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h4>Defense</h4><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><h4>Dueling</h4><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h4>Great Weapon Fighting</h4><p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p><h4>Protection</h4><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the paladin spell list.</p><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4><p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p><h3>Divine Smite</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p><h3>Divine Health</h3><p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p><h3>Sacred Oath</h3><p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p><h3>Oath Spells</h3><p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h3>Aura of Protection</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Aura of Courage</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Improved Divine Smite</h3><p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p><h3>Cleansing Touch</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Aura Improvements</h3><p>At 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.</p><h2>Optional Class Features</h2><h3>Additional Wizard Spells</h3><h4>1st-level wizard feature</h4><p>The spells in the following list expand the wizard spell list in the Player’s Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. A spell’s school of magic is noted, and if a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell’s name. Each spell is in the Player’s Handbook, unless it has an asterisk (a spell in chapter 3 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything). Xanathar’s Guide to Everything also offers more spells.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Additional Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2nd</td><td>Gentle repose, Prayer of healing, Warding bond</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Spirit shroud*</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>Summon celestial*</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Fighting Style Options</h3><p><em>2nd-level paladin feature</em></p><p>When you choose a fighting style, the following styles are added to your list of options.</p><h4>Blessed Warrior</h4><p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.</p><h4>Blind Fighting</h4><p>You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p><h4>Interception</h4><p>When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p><h3>Harness Divine Power</h3><p><em>3rd-level paladin feature</em></p><p>You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you’ve reached in this class: 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Martial Versatility</h3><p><em>4th-level paladin feature</em></p><p>Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to paladins. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":1,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-4-class-features.r9v44iSRIl77LOYd"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":4,"title":"ASI/Feat","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"IOZ33kByqrpXxBP3"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-4-class-features.r9v44iSRIl77LOYd"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"ASI","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"GJ2yF8gFp3ASeL82"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-4-class-features.r9v44iSRIl77LOYd"],"optional":true,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":12,"title":"ASI","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"jaFMFkGmJfzrxEWP"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-4-class-features.r9v44iSRIl77LOYd"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":16,"title":"ASI","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"BiyE8ObEuqDCL1X3"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-4-class-features.r9v44iSRIl77LOYd"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":19,"title":"ASI","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"u0Tn08bJSQIOMaXd"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-4-class-features.bieiX6OQLp5Hb10a"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Feature","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"srvwmXyxpSwjyZ4i"},{"type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"Hit

Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><h2>Scholars of the Arcane</h2><p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p><p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p><h2>The Lure of Knowledge</h2><p>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p><h2>Creating a Wizard</h2><p>Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?</p><p>What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p><p>You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions.

features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d6 per wizard level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 6 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Intelligence, Wisdom</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose any two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine and Religion.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li><p>(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger</p></li><li><p>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</p></li><li><p>(a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</p></li><li><p>A spellbook</p></li></ul><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p><h4>Spellbook</h4><p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4><p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h4>Ritual Casting</h4><p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p><h4>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h4><p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p><p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong>. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p><p><strong>The Book’s Appearance</strong>. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p></aside><h3>Arcane Recovery</h3><p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p><p>For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p><h3>Arcane Tradition</h3><p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p><h3>Spell Mastery</h3><p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p><p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p><h3>Signature Spells</h3><p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p><h2>Optional Class Features</h2><h3>Additional Wizard Spells</h3><h4>1st-level wizard feature</h4><p>The spells in the following list expand the wizard spell list in the Player’s Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. A spell’s school of magic is noted, and if a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell’s name. Each spell is in the Player’s Handbook, unless it has an asterisk (a spell in chapter 3 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything). Xanathar’s Guide to Everything also offers more spells.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Additional Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cantrip</td><td>Booming blade * (evoc.), Green-flame blade * (evoc.), Lightning lure * (evoc.), Mind sliver * (ench.), Sword burst * (conj.)</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>Tasha’s caustic brew * (evoc.)</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>Augury (divin., ritual), Enhance ability (trans.), Tasha’s mind whip * (ench.)</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Intellect fortress * (abjur.), Speak with dead (necro.), Spirit shroud * (necro.), Summon fey * (conj.), Summon shadowspawn * (conj.), Summon undead * (conj.)</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>Divination (divin., ritual), Summon aberration * (conj.), Summon construct * (conj.), Summon elemental * (conj.)</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>Summon fiend * (conj.), Tasha’s otherworldly guise * (trans.)</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>Dream of the blue veil * (conj.)</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>Blade of disaster * (conj.)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Cantrip Formulas</h3><p><em>3rd-level wizard feature</em></p><p>You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind.

{"name":"Warlock","type":"class","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/DnDBeyond/images/class-icons/warlock.jpeg","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p><p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p><p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p><p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p><h2>Sworn and Beholden</h2><p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.</p><p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p><h2>Delvers into Secrets</h2><p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p><p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p><p>Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p><h2>Creating a Warlock</h2><p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p><p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p><p>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p><p>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see.

Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3>Pact Magic</h3><p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the warlock spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p><h4>Spell Slots</h4><p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p><h4>Spells Known</h4><p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p><h3>Eldritch Invocations</h3><p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</p><p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p><p>If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p><h4>Agonizing Blast</h4><p>Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip</p><p>When you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.</p><h4>Armor of Shadows</h4><p>You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p><h4>Ascendant Step</h4><p>Prerequisite: 9th level</p><p>You can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p><h4>Aspect of the Moon</h4><p>Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature</p><p>You no longer need to sleep and can’t be forced to sleep by any means.

Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.</p><p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell.

To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.</p><p>As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.</p><h4>Fiendish Vigor</h4><p>You can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.</p><h4>Gaze of Two Minds</h4><p>You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.</p><h4>Ghostly Gaze</h4><p>Prerequisite: 7th level</p><p>As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have darkvision if you don’t already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p><p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter.

When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.</p><p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p><h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

spell list.</p><p>Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature’s other options.</p><p>If you’re 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum

{"name":"Sorcerer","type":"class","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/DnDBeyond/images/class-icons/sorcerer.jpeg","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p><p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p><p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p><p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p><h3>Raw Magic</h3><p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p><p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p><p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p><h3>Unexplained Powers</h3><p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.</p><p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p><h3>Creating a Sorcerer</h3><p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p><p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p><p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and magic missile.</p></aside><table><thead><tr><th

the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d6 per sorcerer level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 6 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>: Constitution, Charisma</p><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li><p>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</p></li><li><p>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</p></li><li><p>(a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</p></li><li><p>Two daggers</p></li></ul><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the sorcerer spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p><h4>Spell Slots</h4><p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p><h3>Sorcerous Origin</h3><p>Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source.</p><p>Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p><h3>Font of Magic</h3><p>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p><h4>Sorcery Points</h4><p>You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels. Your sorcerer level equals the number of sorcery points you have, so a 4th level sorcerer has 4 sorcery points, a 16th level sorcerer has 16. You can never have more sorcery points than your level dictates.  You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Flexible Casting</h4><p>You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.</p><p><em><strong>Creating Spell Slots</strong>.</em>You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.</p><p>Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.</p><h5>Creating Spell Slots</h5><table border=\"1\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Spell Slot Level</strong></td><td><strong>Sorcery Point Cost</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points</strong>.</em>As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.</p><h3>Metamagic</h3><p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.</p><p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p><h4>Careful Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.</p><h4>Distant Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.</p><p>When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</p><h4>Empowered Spell</h4><p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p><p>You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p><h4>Extended Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</p><h4>Heightened Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.</p><h4>Quickened Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p><h4>Subtle Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p><h4>Twinned Spell</h4><p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).</p><p>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p><h3>Sorcerous Restoration</h3><p>At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.</p><h2>Optional Class Features</h2><h3>Additional Sorcerer Spells</h3><p><em>1st-level sorcerer feature</em></p><p>The spells in the following list expand the sorcerer spell list in the Player’s Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell’s name.

{"name":"Bard","type":"class","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/DnDBeyond/images/class-icons/bard.jpeg","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.</p><p>A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p><p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions’ words will be well received.</p><p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p><h2>Music and Magic</h2><p>In the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p><h2>Learning from Experience</h2><p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p><h2>Creating a Bard</h2><p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character’s background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p><p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p><p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the entertainer background.

following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per bard level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> Three musical instruments of your choice</p><p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Charisma</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose any three</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li><p>(a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon</p></li><li><p>(a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer’s pack</p></li><li><p>(a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument</p></li><li><p>Leather armor and a dagger</p></li></ul><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the bard spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</p><h4>Spell Slots</h4><p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4><p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h4>Ritual Casting</h4><p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use a musical instrument (see the Tools section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p><h3>Bardic Inspiration</h3><p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</p><p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p><h3>Jack of All Trades</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</p><h3>Song of Rest</h3><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p><p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p><h3>Bard College</h3><p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h3>Expertise</h3><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p><h3>Font of Inspiration</h3><p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Countercharm</h3><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p><h3>Expertise</h3><p>At 10th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><h3>Magical Secrets</h3><p>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p><p>The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p><p>You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p><h3>Magical Secrets</h3><p>At 14th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines.

{"name":"Cleric","type":"class","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/DnDBeyond/images/class-icons/cleric.jpeg","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.</p><p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe’s fall.</p><p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p><h2>Healers and Warriors</h2><p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p><h2>Divine Agents</h2><p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p><h2>Creating a Cleric</h2><p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody. The Gods of the Multiverse section includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.</p><p>Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p><p>You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.</p></aside><h2>The Cleric Table</h2><table><thead><tr><th rowspan=\"2\">Level</th><th rowspan=\"2\"><p>Proficiency<br />Bonus</p></th><th

class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d8 per cleric level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 8 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Light armor, medium armor, shields</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Simple weapons</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>: Wisdom, Charisma</p><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li><p>(a) a mace or (b) a warhammer (if proficient)</p></li><li><p>(a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient)</p></li><li><p>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</p></li><li><p>(a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</p></li><li><p>A shield and a holy symbol</p></li></ul><h2>Spellcasting</h2><p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the cleric spell list.</p><h4>Cantrips</h4><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4><p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h4>Ritual Casting</h4><p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4><p>You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p><h3>Divine Domain</h3><p>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the Player’s Handbook for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p><h4>Domain Spells</h4><p>Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p><h4>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h4><p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p><h3>Destroy Undead</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p><h4>Destroy Undead</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Destroys Undead of CR …</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5th</td><td>1/2 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>1 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>2 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>4 or lower</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Divine Intervention</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p><p>Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p><p>If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p><p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p><h2>Optional Class Features</h2><h3>Additional Cleric Spells</h3><p><em>1st-level cleric feature</em></p><p>The spells in the following list expand the cleric spell list in the Player’s Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell’s name. Each spell is in the Player’s Handbook, unless it has an asterisk (a spell in chapter 3 of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything). Xanathar’s Guide to Everything also offers more spells.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Additional Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Aura of vitality, Spirit Shroud *</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>Aura of life, Aura of purity</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>Summon celestial *</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>Sunbeam</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>8thSunburst</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>Power word heal</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Harness Divine Power</h3><p><em>2nd-level cleric feature</em></p><p>You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you’ve reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice.

{"name":"Rogue","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target — a notorious slaver — passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><h2>Skill and Precision</h2><p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p><h2>A Shady Living</h2><p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p><h2>Creating a Rogue</h2><p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p><p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.</p></aside><h3>The Rogue Table</h3><table><thead><tr><th><p>Level</p></th><th><p>Proficiency<br />Bonus</p></th><th><p>Sneak<br />Attack</p></th><th><p>Features</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1st</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>1d6</p></td><td><p>Expertise, Sneak Attack, Thieves' Cant</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2nd</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>1d6</p></td><td><p>Cunning Action</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3rd</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>2d6</p></td><td><p>Roguish Archetype</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4th</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>2d6</p></td><td><p>Ability Score Improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5th</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td><td><p>3d6</p></td><td><p>Uncanny Dodge</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6th</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td><td><p>3d6</p></td><td><p>Expertise</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7th</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td><td><p>4d6</p></td><td><p>Evasion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8th</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td><td><p>4d6</p></td><td><p>Ability Score Improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9th</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>5d6</p></td><td><p>Roguish Archetype Feature</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10th</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>5d6</p></td><td><p>Ability Score Improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11th</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>6d6</p></td><td><p>Reliable Talent</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12th</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>6d6</p></td><td><p>Ability Score Improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13th</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td><td><p>7d6</p></td><td><p>Roguish Archetype Feature</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>14th</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td><td><p>7d6</p></td><td><p>Blindsense</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15th</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td><td><p>8d6</p></td><td><p>Slippery Mind</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16th</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td><td><p>8d6</p></td><td><p>Ability Score Improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17th</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td><td><p>9d6</p></td><td><p>Roguish Archetype Feature</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18th</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td><td><p>9d6</p></td><td><p>Elusive</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19th</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td><td><p>10d6</p></td><td><p>Ability Score Improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20th</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td><td><p>10d6</p></td><td><p>Stroke of Luck</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Class Features</h2><p>As a rogue, you have the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per rogue level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> Thieves’ tools</p><p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li><p>(a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword</p></li><li><p>(a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword</p></li><li><p>(a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an explorer’s pack</p></li><li><p>Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</p></li></ul><h3>Expertise</h3><p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p><h3>Sneak Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p><p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p><p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p><h3>Thieves’ Cant</h3><p>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p><p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p><h3>Cunning Action</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p><h3>Roguish Archetype</h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p><h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p><h3>Expertise</h3><p>At 6th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies, or one more of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><h3>Evasion</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3>Reliable Talent</h3><p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p><h3>Blindsense</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p><h3>Slippery Mind</h3><p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p><h3>Elusive</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p><h3>Stroke of Luck</h3><p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Optional Class Features</h2><h3>Steady Aim</h3><p>3rd-level rogue feature</p><p>As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB, pg

{"name":"Druid","type":"class","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/61c6079e99b8eb56f3ca7ede/DnDBeyond/images/class-icons/druid.jpeg","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p><p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.</p><p>Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p><p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable will.</p><h2>Power of Nature</h2><p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p><h2>Preserve the Balance</h2><p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for people to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p><h2>Creating a Druid</h2><p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny.</p><p>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>QUICK BUILD</strong></p><p>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions.

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p></aside><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>DRUIDS AND THE GODS</strong></p><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p><p>In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.</p><p>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p></aside><h2>Class Features</h2><p>As a druid, you gain the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: 1d8 per druid level</p><p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level</strong>: 8 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels</strong>: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><strong>Armor</strong>: Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Herbalism kit</p><p><strong>Saving Throws</strong>: Intelligence, Wisdom</p><p><strong>Skills</strong>: Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><p>(a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon</p><p>(a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon</p><p>Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus</p><h3>Druidic</h3><p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.
