If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increases.</strong> When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player’s Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p><p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p><p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the cure wounds spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p><p><strong>Life Span.</strong> The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p><p><strong>Height and Weight.</strong> Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player’s Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p><h2>Firbolg Traits</h2><p>As a firbolg, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><strong>Creature Type. </strong>You are a Humanoid.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Firbolg Magic.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.5Da8MlIT1XmW0lAE]{Firbolg Magic}</p><p><strong>Hidden Step.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.On0fwZK6VIZd3Fvh]{Hidden Step}</p><p><strong>Powerful Build.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.QVs0YOXBpYPOjDAJ]{Powerful Build}</p><p><strong>Speech of Beast and Leaf.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.S4t6fNkFnDQmLbns]{Speech of Beast &amp; Leaf}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MotM, pg 15","advancement":[{"_id":"pULdBHacP3DgpyAP","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.5Da8MlIT1XmW0lAE","Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.On0fwZK6VIZd3Fvh","Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.QVs0YOXBpYPOjDAJ","Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.S4t6fNkFnDQmLbns"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"04AkChibo1yZTfI3":"Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.5Da8MlIT1XmW0lAE","cjK6IkA57uRJLfU2":"Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.On0fwZK6VIZd3Fvh","WR4FTeiMsyOtVt9D":"Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.QVs0YOXBpYPOjDAJ","eQSkpOTn8bkDuIcT":"Compendium.forge-vtt-shared-compendiums-peashooters-ddb.item-8-racial-traits.S4t6fNkFnDQmLbns"}},"level":1,"title":"Racial Features"}]},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"600be207fb1ef69765c655b5c5107cab857b6d7e","sourceId":"Actor.Sn2qcFnE2ABIsENc.Item.mHVIQN96c6fxqpeX"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.iP80KpXvZ73tZOSE"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682985644230,"modifiedTime":1682987453144,"lastModifiedBy":"I44BrFcnzbKJHXtW"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"NNpF38xB195XMv1G"}

He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the ground. The dwarf clasped his old friend close for a brief instant, then, remembering his dignity, squirmed and freed himself from the half-elf’s embrace.</p><p>- Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, Dragons of Autumn Twilight</p></aside><p>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</p><h2>Of Two Worlds</h2><p>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.</p><h2>Diplomats or Wanderers</h2><p>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.</p><p>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.</p><h2>Half-Elf Names</h2><p>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>EXCELLENT AMBASSADORS</strong></p><p>Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other).</p></aside><h2>Half-Elf Variants</h2><p>Some half-elves in Faerûn have a racial trait in place of the Skill Versatility trait. If your DM allows it, your half-elf character can forgo Skill Versatility and instead take the elf trait Keen Senses or a trait based on your elf parentage:</p><h2>Half-Elf Traits</h2><p>Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.</p><p>Ability Score Increase</p><p>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.</p><h3>Age</h3><p>Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><h3>Darkvision</h3><p>Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

They can fan that spark to bring light, ease wounds, and unleash the fury of the heavens. Aasimar can arise among any population of mortals.</p><p>They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and often have features that hint at their celestial heritage. These often begin subtle and become more obvious when the aasimar gains the ability to reveal their full celestial nature. The Aasimar Celestial Features table has examples you can choose or use as inspiration to create your own.</p><h5>Aasimar Celestial Features</h5><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Celestial Feature</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>A dusting of metallic, white, or charcoal freckles</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Metallic, luminous, or dark eyes</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Starkly colored hair</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>An unusual hue tinting your shadow</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A ghostly halo crowning your head</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Rainbows gleaming on your skin</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Creating Your Character</h2><p>At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. If you select a fantastical race, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p><h3>Ability Score Increases</h3><p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character’s class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20.</p><h3>Languages</h3><p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player’s Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</p><h3>Creature Type</h3><p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including each player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p><p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the cure wounds spell doesn’t work on a Construct or an Undead.</p><h3>Life Span</h3><p>The typical life span of a player character in the D&amp;D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries. If typical members of a race can live longer than a century, that fact is mentioned in the race’s description.</p><h3>Height and Weight</h3><p>Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player’s Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p><h2>Aasimar Traits</h2><p>As an aasimar, you have the following racial traits.</p><h3>Creature Type</h3><p>You are a Humanoid.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>You are Medium or Small.
