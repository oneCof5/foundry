These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.</p><p>Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better.

This ability doesn’t grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</p><p>Spirit Totem</p><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point.

In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.</p><p>Hawk Spirit. The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.</p><p>Unicorn Spirit. The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</p><p>Mighty Summoner</p><p>Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal.

When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside — at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins — sometimes called avengers or dark knights — their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</p><aside class=\"block-torn-paper\"><p><strong>TENETS OF VENGEANCE</strong></p><p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</p><p><strong>Fight the Greater Evil</strong>. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.</p><p><strong>No Mercy for the Wicked</strong>. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</p><p><strong>By Any Means Necessary</strong>. My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.</p><p><strong>Restitution</strong>. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</p></aside><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><strong>Abjure Enemy</strong>. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</p><p>On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p><p><strong>Vow of Enmity</strong>. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.</p><h3>Oath Spells</h3><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><h4>Oath of Vengeance Spells</h4><table><thead><tr><th><p>Paladin<br />Level</p></th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>bane, hunter's mark</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>hold person, misty step</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>haste, protection from energy</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>banishment, dimension door</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>hold monster, scrying</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Relentless Avenger</h3><p>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p><h3>Soul of Vengeance</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p><h3>Avenging Angel</h3><p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:</p><p>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</p><p>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius.
