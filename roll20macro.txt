Speed, {{name=Potion of Speed}} {{source=[Potion of Speed](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items%3APotion%20of%20Speed)}} {{description=When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the **haste** spell for 1 minute (no concentration required).
**[Haste](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:haste).** Until the effect ends, Boots' speed is doubled, he gains a +2 bonus to AC, he has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and he gains an additional action on each of his turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
When the spell ends, Boots can't move or take actions until after his next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over him.
